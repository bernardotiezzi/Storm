@VirginAmerica it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious "entertainment" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse
@VirginAmerica and it's a really big bad thing about it
@VirginAmerica seriously would pay $30 a flight for seats that didn't have this playing.
it's really the only bad thing about flying VA
@VirginAmerica SFO-PDX schedule is still MIA.
@VirginAmerica  I flew from NYC to SFO last week and couldn't fully sit in my seat due to two large gentleman on either side of me. HELP!
@VirginAmerica why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select???
@VirginAmerica you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ... ðŸ˜¡ I want free internet
@VirginAmerica status match program.  I applied and it's been three weeks.  Called and emailed with no response.

@VirginAmerica Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?
@VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag
@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt
@VirginAmerica what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
@VirginAmerica why can't you supp the biz traveler like @SouthwestAir  and have customer service like @JetBlue #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@VirginAmerica you're the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I'm delayed and Late Flight :(
@VirginAmerica I have no interesting flying with you after this. I will Cancelled Flight my next four flights I planned.#neverflyvirginforbusiness
@VirginAmerica it was a disappointing experience which will be shared with every business traveler I meet. #neverflyvirgin
@VirginAmerica Iâ€™m having trouble adding this flight my wife booked to my Elevate account. Help? http://t.co/pX8hQOKS3R
@VirginAmerica Why is the site down?  When will it be back up?
@VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
@VirginAmerica just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin
@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign.
@VirginAmerica I can't check in or add a bag. Your website isn't working. I've tried both desktop and mobile http://t.co/AvyqdMpi1Y
@VirginAmerica - Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable
@virginamerica What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
@VirginAmerica is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.
@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
@virginamerica how's a direct flight FLL-&gt;SFO have unexpected layover in Vegas 4 fuel yet peeps next to me bought for Vegas flight. #sneaky
@VirginAmerica your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp.
@VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
@VirginAmerica your site is tripping. I'm trying to check in and I'm getting the plain text version. I am reluctant to enter any card info.
@VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a "tech stop"?
@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website?
@VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?
@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
@VirginAmerica i need to change my flight thats scheduled in 9 hours and 120 min wait time on phone. Im calling intern. Help!!
@VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
@VirginAmerica @FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry
@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
@VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
@VirginAmerica I need to register a service dog for a first class ticket from SFO &gt; Dulles. The phone queue is an hour or longer. Pls advise
@VirginAmerica why can't we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated
@VirginAmerica You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame
@VirginAmerica please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it's on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas
@VirginAmerica I paid the premium to fly you across the country, you Cancelled Flight my flight and offer no check fee or upgrade love? Sad face :(
@VirginAmerica question: is it not possible to book a seat for an infant under 2? It's not giving me the option but we want a seat for him.
.@VirginAmerica I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy.
.@VirginAmerica does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?
@VirginAmerica having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait.
@VirginAmerica How do I reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flights online? The change button is greyed out!
@VirginAmerica I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site
@VirginAmerica got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable.
@VirginAmerica our flight into lga was Cancelled Flighted. We're stuck in Dallas. I called to reschedule, told I could get a flight for today...(1/2)
@virginamerica why don't any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter
@VirginAmerica is the website down?
@VirginAmerica - Your site seems a little wonked right now. May want to have a look. Tried on two browsers. No CSS? http://t.co/8qsQMM7KF2
@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
@VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh
@VirginAmerica at Logan airport and waiting to checkin for my 9am flight. Checkin desk not open !!!!! Why?!
@VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher...
@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
@VirginAmerica - too many apologies! You r the worse airlines! Don't even respond to your cudtomers
@VirginAmerica shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me?
@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
@VirginAmerica Flight from BOS &gt; LAS tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. No notification; wait times are 1+ hour. Will you rebook on another airline?
@VirginAmerica a lot of "apologies" being thrown out to customers from what I can see.Very sad. Thanks for nothing. Worst airline ever.
@VirginAmerica  for all my flight stuff wrong and did nothing about it. Had #worst #flight ever
@VirginAmerica trying to book a flight with you guys and your website won't let me... about to lose my business

@VirginAmerica Your website is down and I'm trying to check in!
@VirginAmerica seats in Row 8 don't recline should mention that on your website #soreback
@VirginAmerica flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
@VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flights today? No precipitation to be scared of!  â„ï¸â„ï¸â„ï¸
@VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?
@VirginAmerica canâ€™t access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
@VirginAmerica your mobile site is broken, shows 
"{{header.elevateUser.numOfPointsAvailable || '0' | number}} Points", won't let me checkin
@VirginAmerica I was really looking forward to my flight. can you let me know when it will be rescheduled? #diehardvirgin

@VirginAmerica I was so looking forward to my first flight with you today but it was Cancelled Flightled along with the subsequent one ...

@VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable.
@VirginAmerica We're on flight 910 Vegas to Boston today, checked in online but our bag count didn't register. Can I fix that somehow?
@VirginAmerica Hi, I'm trying to do check-in but the website is not working. I tried 3 different browsers and the problem continues
@VirginAmerica - the passenger in 7D, Flt 338 that assaulted me shouldn't have flown. I trust he's banned. Crew filed report to @FAANews
@VirginAmerica current bug on website shows â€˜select departure cityâ€™ when selecting destination city http://t.co/SLLYIBE2vQ
@VirginAmerica luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn't any help.
@VirginAmerica requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat. Not a good way to treat silver memberðŸ˜’
@VirginAmerica #wtf I paid for direct flight on purpose not to have to stop for fuel exhausted frequent flier and nothing for inconvenience!
@VirginAmerica there is something wrong with you website in Safari iPhone
@VirginAmerica Already checked in so the page expired :X
@VirginAmerica Boo for a not refunding a seat upgrade fee I did not want to buy in the first place!
@VirginAmerica moved my seat with no notice. "Better seat" is cabin select not behind the row I selectedðŸ‘Ž #DISAPPOINTED
@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
@VirginAmerica Is there anything going on with the website? I've been getting a lot of errors past 30 minutes.
@VirginAmerica @VirginAtlantic I have just checked in flight to SFO from LAX &amp; been told as Atlantic Flying Club Gold I get no benefits?!
@VirginAmerica husband and I ordered three drinks via my screen and they never came. Awesome!
@VirginAmerica soooo are you guys going to leave the seatbelt light on all flight? You can barely call this turbulence :-)
@VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this!
@VirginAmerica I'm trying to check into my 10:50AM CT flight tmm on the desktop website and it's not working (some sort of caching bug) SOS
@VirginAmerica Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? http://t.co/2npXB6oBMr
@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff
@VirginAmerica The Flight Booking Problems section of your website seems to be broken on Chrome. Might wanna look into that.
@virginamerica Looks like a broken link for your assets https://t.co/OArDjjGrrD
@virginamerica the manage itinerary section of your website seems to be broken for me https://t.co/2pUJvCElNg
@VirginAmerica can't check in, your site looks like this every time it loads http://t.co/kAcY2AwDbW
@virginAmerica Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW
@VirginAmerica WTF is happening in PDX Late Flight March such that one way from SFO is ~$550?
@VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I've filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage.
@VirginAmerica I requested a mileage challenge for status several weeks ago online but haven't heard back. How do I get help with this?
@VirginAmerica Just trying to book tickets to NYC and facing super fun broken styling. Don't worry, I'll keep trying :)
@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly ðŸ˜¥
@VirginAmerica trying to check-in...but looks like your site is down?
@VirginAmerica spending my birthday night with you, DAL-DCA. Get me home!
@VirginAmerica Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers.
@VirginAmerica seriously, though. will there not be direct flights from SFO-FLL in may???
@VirginAmerica It's fine. Already done with my purchase. But you should try it. Just go most of the way through then go back 3
@virginamerica not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board
@VirginAmerica
wjere is our luggage #so slow at lax
@VirginAmerica I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on @VirginAtlantic as well
@VirginAmerica I am deeply disappointed that your birthday promo was not applied to a trip I booked mere days before I received the email
@VirginAmerica what happened to direct flights from SFO-FLL? Looking in May, only see connecting #help #dontdothistome
@VirginAmerica I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. 
http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn
@VirginAmerica on VX399 from JFK to LA - dirty plane - not up to your standards.
@VirginAmerica on flight VX399 headed to LA from JFK - dirtiest VA plane I have ever been on. Sad for a great airline.
@VirginAmerica your Avis rental continue button doesn't work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone.  This sucks!
@VirginAmerica delayed to10.30!!
@VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
@VirginAmerica Comenity Bank is a joke!  Please change.  Nothing but constant problems with this bank
@VirginAmerica, I submitted a status match request a while back and still havenâ€™t heard! Iâ€™m flying on Monday. Can you look / accelerate?
@VirginAmerica I'm pulling my hair out trying to book a flight with u. Your site doesn't work on iPhone or iPad.don't have a computer #help
@VirginAmerica Can I get some help with a support ticket? It's been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you!
@VirginAmerica I cannot even open my laptop in seat 4C and I paid a premium for this?!!   Let me out of here!
@VirginAmerica I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!!
@VirginAmerica FYI the info@virginamerica.com email address you say to contact in password reset emails doesn't exist. Emails bounce.
@VirginAmerica Status match - 2 weeks have gone by and no news.Flt next week - hope flt will count towards requirement.  Cust Svc no help!!!
@VirginAmerica your website sucks donkey dicks. Just thought you should know. All best.
@VirginAmerica all crap channels which is why I pay to watch UK tv
@VirginAmerica how come you don't have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper.
@VirginAmerica Your back of seat entertainment system does not accept credit cards that  have an apostrophe in the surname. #apostrophefail
@VirginAmerica When will VX use all 6 LGA slots instead of 4 today? Adding AUS makes this less likely :(
@VirginAmerica sad to learn you no longer fly SFO &gt; PHL. Hope it returns!
@VirginAmerica kinda sucked my earphone jack didn't work on my flight. They may want to look into that for future passengers
@VirginAmerica Very poor experience. First computer problem now seat malfunction. Stuck. Missing meeting in San Diego.
@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time.
@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?
@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
@VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!
@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
@VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
@VirginAmerica Man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too.
@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!
@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)â€¦tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
@VirginAmerica mood lighting on pointðŸ™Œ Reclining my seat, kickin up my feetðŸ’¤
@VirginAmerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay?
@VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either ðŸ˜¡
@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock.
@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!
@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child
@united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said @united
@united beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting
@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner.
@united thats weak. See ya ðŸ‘‹
Hey @VirginAmerica !!
@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy
@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but...
@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB
@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice.
@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer
@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward.
@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
@united rude rude
@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told "we can't find a supervisor."
@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
@united I will not be flying you again
@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
@united v upset with your disability  "services". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude.
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement.
@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you ðŸ˜¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it.
@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united crashed trying to check in.
@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
@united Blackmailed me into paying Â£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  âœŒï¸out.
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.
@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx
@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know
@united I'm grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me?
@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?
@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancÃ©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines
@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim
@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
@united plus what about food? And taxis?
@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: "Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."
@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
â€œ@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KNâ€ I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
@united good to know you will open the closed doors for "premier passengers" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed.
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
@united why would they make me share a room?
@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'
@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like
@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags.
@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible "provide a death certificate' policy
@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigatedâ€”my time wasted (2/2)
@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
@united That's correctâ€”I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your controlâ€”the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn.
@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
@united GRK13575M is the file reference
@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a "wrong" price on your siteâ€”it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness.
@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?
â€œ@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JPâ€ what's the point of membership?
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@united Dmed you. Thank you
@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!
@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
@united where's my damn bag??
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example.
@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle.
@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
@united So you are inadequate by accident?
@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
@united ...and when that doesn't work...
@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggageâ€¦ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious "costs" that you incur, @united?
@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry.
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i "have" to fly with you.
@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
@united I did... no response back
@united this is atrocious customer service.
@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited
@united I will but right now I'm to angry
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around
@united I think DM would be better
@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude.
@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines.
@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people
@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted.
@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!
@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked.
@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out.
@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep.
@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!
@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD
@united This must be a drone â€œ@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."
@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though.
@united flight attendant doesnâ€™t understand not understanding English doesnâ€™t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.
@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents ðŸ‘¿
@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not
@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?
@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?
@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!
@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence.
@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?
@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ
@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are
@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense
@united go to hell
@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse
@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily.
@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people
@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
@united already missed  connection ugh
@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft.
@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@united that's not even an apology
@united that's cool - now what?
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv
@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room
@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine.
@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?
@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING
@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!
@united In 2015, United is "unable" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice
@united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981
@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!
@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to "sick pilot". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care.
@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member ðŸ˜”
@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for "maintenance" it could be the same issue 2day
@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than "maintenance".
@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.
@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out.
@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags
@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi
@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?
@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. "No crew".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to "get to NY to catch @AirCanada" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead.
@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt
@united  gate agent at EWR " if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step". STEP UP??? Lol
@united it won't help...been there done that.
@united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals
@united today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag
@united we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal
@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over
@united 3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap
@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details.
@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? ðŸ˜­
@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!
@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!
@united Haâ€¦ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes.
@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
@united still no response??
@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
@united There is no "reference number." Your agent told me to "just drive to the airport" because "I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."
@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
@united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?
@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!
@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way
@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants.
@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead
@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!
@united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule...
@united 2nd flight in two weeks that you have lost my bag!  Taking my 1K status to @AmericanAir #neveragain #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues
@united Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone.
@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help
@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR.
@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
@united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!
@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@united at this point I made it home on my own.
@united I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go.
J
@united you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I'm at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place.
@united it wasn't a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response
@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!
@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@united how about starting without the robotic response?
@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here.
@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck.
@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR
@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500
@united I'm on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService
@united as a freq flyer it makes me sad to see cust needing assistance treated so poorly. #ServiceFail
@united day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice
@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.
@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
@united WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu
@United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.
@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning
@united Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?
.@united You may "dislike delays" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time.
@united #epicfail on #CX as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay
@united I'm aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit
@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
@united hilarious
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
@United "Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."
@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
@united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm
@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee
@united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!
@united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool.
UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.
@united never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight
@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...
@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
@united - it's been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?
@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
@united I guess you have to "follow" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send.
@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback
@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?
@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to "check in" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa
@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your "Premier" groups might be an indication of a broken process.
@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again.
@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet
@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH
@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
@united literally sucks
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket
@united First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised....
@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
@united it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail
@united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?
@united you are terrible.
@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight
@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
@united â€¦ But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR
@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 â€¦
@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
@united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.
@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue
@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 ("uplink prob"). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?
@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage.
@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!
@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??
@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?
@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i donâ€™t see that it has taken off yet
@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night "as fast as they can", you should reconsider what you think that means.
@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United
@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx
@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.
@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away
@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
@united it will be on a different airline.
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
@united clicked "upgrade now" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59
@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
@united i need help but in spanish
@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN
@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA
@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like "attempting to locate luggage"
@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.
@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
@United "delayed due to customer service" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from SÃ£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.
@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484
@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.
@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
@united lol too little too Late Flight
@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
@united your seats are god awful.
@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
@united i sure will
@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?
@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s.
@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay.
@united I need help with a missing bag.
@united I was. But I have given up.
@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?
@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
@united why do you hate your passengers?
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
@united false.
@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
.@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim
@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines
@united you guys suck, 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and didn't even have curtesy to let me know,  #UnitedAirlines
@united Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays.
@united seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever
@united but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed).
@united what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me?
@united been good 15yr "friendly skies" relationship. 2day agent told me I'm "only Canadian" and thus not good enough for military preboard
@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots
â€œ@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JPâ€ inconvience*
â€œ@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JPâ€ the service just hasn't been great.
.@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it.
@united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever
@united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle.
@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
.@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?
@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
@united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
@united @lpdstock tweet bots obviously don't get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people.
@united customer service what's That???
@united -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Returning for 'more quick fixes' &amp; breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline
@united Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!!
@united that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!
@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
@united now this http://t.co/uygeW2Nosr
@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles
@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
@united seriously what's with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn't go up!
. @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines
@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!
@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!
@united no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @ErieAirport
@united every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card.
@united so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage
@united 8 hours Late Flightr and I'm siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service!
@united We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags
@united now let there also pls be in-flight live TV on UA469 DEN-EWR so I can watch the #Oscars ??
@Unitedâ€‹ has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight &amp; the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status.
@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
@united you guys are complete ass
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k
@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a "snow storm in Denver". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+
@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous "I dunno what time you will leave today. ". Dunno?! That's code for ...?
@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor.
@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending
@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?
@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?
@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
@united ouch not fair
@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
@united flight delayed...again...every time. "Maintenance issues"
@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email.
@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...âœˆï¸
@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules.
@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space.
@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable.
@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
@united agent, "You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full." Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited
@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks.
@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update.
@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me
@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst
@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????
@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !
@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
@united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing.
@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc
@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The "weather" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx
@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol
@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that canâ€™t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
â€œ@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^MLâ€:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?
@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!
@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations.
@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service.
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff
@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good.
@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service ðŸ‘Ž
@united you guys are gay
@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!
@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??
@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?
@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?
@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
@united is by far the worst airline ever ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them.
@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch
Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I shouldâ€™ve had yesterday, itâ€™s $514 today. Thanks.
@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?
@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I
@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to
@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on
@united delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don't care about our shoes. Ua649
@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed
@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a "no show"
@united never flying United again! Worst experience ever
@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went.
@united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep
@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
@united direct messages not going through please help
@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium.
@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai
@united so what's the solution?
@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
@united severely under staffed at Iah.
@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs
@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming
@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
â€œ@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JHâ€ always blame the customer
@united not my luggage
@united it's boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe
@united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR ðŸ†–
@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting
@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together
@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've
@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!
.@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO
@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that "really there are 3 not 4 seats"
@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?
@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?
@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada
@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
@united I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your 'trained' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time
@united 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here
@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
@united, more lies... http://t.co/BEqoTLNugc
@united they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..
@united after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired
@united, I don't believe that you do.. http://t.co/7z3GqEBfK2
@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks
@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
@united fuck you for not caring ðŸ˜¢
@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up.
@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!
@united Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home!
@united  of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll
@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
@united @delta lost my luggage from ATL to  hdn luggage in denver and said @united will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785
@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
@united Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but...
@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
@united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks
@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
@united I would never fly United Airlines again!
@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.
@united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
@united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow
@united Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying "think about your next flight..." #customer #outrage http://t.co/KkwiwI97A4
@united did your super computer ðŸ’© ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers
@united - you rebooked me to UA1764 after UA 3883 was Cancelled Flightled. I paid for first class ticket - but new seat is 38E. Can you please fix!
@united is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better.
@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
@united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day
@united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491
@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
@united no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay. The replacement flight leaves Late FlightR than this one was scheduled tomorrow. Not cool.
@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
@united On hold 2X 60 min ea. Trying to bk a tix to Asia. Your website &amp; customer service dont want my business. Korea Air it is.
@united I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund.
@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?
@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport "customer service line" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv
@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed "help"
@united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp
@united lost bag on next flight. Didn't have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold
@united A day Late Flightr, one delayed &amp; one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting.
@united can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time?   #1531.  Let's go.......
@united What does delayed due to Customer Service mean for UA761?
@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
@united flight #1 no luck on #standby
@united I'm not sure it will have "next time"...
@united now the weight restriction? 'We'll try to get as many of you as we can on this plane'
@united you a bish
@united Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.
@united is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited
@united flighted delayed for hours. 10pm arrival to Vegas is now 4am. Did you seriously lose my luggage???
@united 2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel
@united still missing my luggage, was promised someone would call, no call so far, flight from Shanghai to DC with connecting flight in ORD
@united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification?
@united since I have an international connection at 9am, I'm hoping for the same thing!
@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room
@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
@united where is my bag?? I'm in Mexico about to go build a house &amp; my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M
@united I know that. Thanks for the standard reply.
@united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you
@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports
@united no my concerns were not addressed
@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks
@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA.
@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
@united you hung up on me again.
@united your "customer service" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!
@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
.@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it.
@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,
@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
@united where is our luggage
@united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx
@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
@united That's called throwing "loyalty" out the window and trying to give less awards.
@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??
@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?
@united that's not an apology. Say it.
@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
@united no apology? Cool.
@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?
@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers....
@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage
@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how "wifi is coming!" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw
@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD
@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?
@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable.
@united Freakin"
@united Suck
@united 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. @ABC11_WTVD
@united 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane
@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #.
@united 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985
@united YOU SUCK!
@united yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age...
@united how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two
@united just DM'd
@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.
@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?
@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks
@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou
@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience
@united flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv
@united 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm
@united considering I'm now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available
@united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!
@united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?
@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards
@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
@united please get me off this plane #UA57
@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed
@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
@united can you make sure Iâ€™m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?
@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff
@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight
@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much
@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would "sit awhile" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm.
@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to "Try again Late Flightr".
@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!
@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
@united you're terrible.
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out
@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
@united and waiting
@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution
@united is the worst
@united still waiting
@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not
@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH
@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful.
@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays.
@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight.
@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would
@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta
@united And yet we still haven't left yet and I can't watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems
@united yr team have me on hold for over an hour unhelpful Pls can you answer my question.
.@united Let us know when you find everyone's luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines
@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.
@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
@united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.
@united we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area
@united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!
@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
@united never again.
@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit.
@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
@united sucks.
@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.
@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
@united says @USAirways  is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im  sorry. I want my clothes!!
@united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous!
@united most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx
@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
@united you have a culture issue
@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
@united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
@united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!
@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost
@united i'm glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United
@united u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2
@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?
@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
@united just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip.
@united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke
@united meant changed planes - i hate seating over wing if u wanted I would have booked it - u will get formal complaint
@united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I've even though I have platinum and the other person none
@united havenâ€™t before and havenâ€™t this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in caseâ€”nothing
@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
@united no wheelchairs
@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me.
@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt
@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection
@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?
@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
@united please don't take my membership away :(
@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning.
@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!
@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
@united yepâ€”used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, â€œthank you for submitting your requestâ€
@united please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L
@united any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault
@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain
@united great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don't know how you manage to do it.
@united the worst customer service in Denver.
@united ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ
@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
@united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice
@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, "not with my hands!" #badservice
@united I need #United to be a better airline!!
@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice
@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.
@united ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes
@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?
@united I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow
@united flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous
@united You shouldn't page o'head that it's best to call 1-800# - on hold 26+ mins
@united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try #Delta
@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
@united hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first
@united can't get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can't be looked in the eyes by anyone.
@united nope. Called, lost the seating preference I paid for, and here I still sit. We'll see what happens w/ my flight Late Flightr.
@united stuck in DC trying to get to Denver. The engine shut down twice on us at the terminal. Got any available flights for me?
@united yes 1427 Cancelled Flightled. Moved to 333. I'll figure out car rental changes and such.
@united troubling news, time to raise the bar on legroom! http://t.co/nmbHNGnMkI
@united terrible travel experience. Traveled 8000 miles roundtrip but two Cancelled Flightlations of short hops cost me two days
@united why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? https://t.co/AgPb45v8wt
@United my flight from MCO has been delayed &amp; scheduled to arrive after my connection departs. What options do I have?
@united is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness
@united I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip
@united. DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help?
@united well if you don't want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally!! #fakesincerity
@united employees are the angriest, angst-iest group of people anywhere (except for Tasha at check-in at IAH.) @dad_or_alive
@united But it's doubtful he'll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America
@united Worst customer non-service for sure!
@united Worst airline ever?
@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
@united need assistance. Line is out the door and travelling with 3 kids.
@united Friend at O'Hare and can't get on flight bc they say no proof he bought 1st class tkt. He has boarding pass.
@United Right now at Tropic Air in San Pedro, #Belize. Line out the door. All due to elected &amp; appointed hacks http://t.co/kKEDjNRTWoâ€
@united Your new mileage policy is awful. Before, I might have paid slightly more for United because of miles. Now there's no difference.
@united can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to Denver had left it's previous destination? Flight 3618
@united yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened
@united I would like 2 speak @United VP of #CustExp Jimmy Samartzis! I sent a survey/email about my awful flight exp http://t.co/OtFZ7CygUQ
@united we are delayed in San Pedro, Belize. We are scheduled to fly out at 3pm from Belize City to Houston. Will you wait please?
@united Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me.
@united Great!  I'm guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you're overcharging, and don't care that everyone is miserable.
@united UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE.
@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/oKtUkjY92O (via @ParachuteGuy)
@united I'm on snowy roads to BWI. I Just called MileagePlus &amp; told flight was Cancelled Flighted 1 1/2 hours ago. I rcvd no notification. Pls help
@united I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me
@united remember in business, a pleasant experience, means you will tell a friend. A bad experience means you will tell everyone you see
@united let me assure you my travel time is 4h2m not 5h2m #timezones #accuratetraveltimes #3rdtimethishashappened http://t.co/e0C9bI09cf
@united U BUMS HOW DO U LOSE THE BIGGEST BAG ON THE FLIGHT
@united is to airlines as @comcast @XFINITY is to cable/internet
@united customers âœ…. Customer service âŒ http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP
@united great decision making skills flight ops IAH bag makes a 10 minute connection and I don't, flight pushed early. Disappointed!!!!
Meanwhile, they fucked my flight. @united: The festivities are already in full swing at the United Fairway Club, overlooking the 17th hole..
@united in the process of purchasing ticket, when prices changed. unbelievable. #RipOffs #PriceDiscrimination
@united although, I am stranded in Chicago O'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal?
@united 14 hours after landing in #ATL &amp; I still do not have my bags...which means no clothes or makeup!!! #UnitedAirlines #nothappy
@united #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines
@united really fucked my day up Hilo to LAX 2hr30min delay because of software? missed connection, getting home 8hrs Late Flightr no upgrade nothin
@united send someone to the customer service counter in person. DIA concourse B across from gate B36a.
@united I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw
@united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
@united it's my 21st birthday and my sister is coming to celebrate but her flights keep Cancelled Flighting PLZ do all you can to get her here!!!!
@united what's the hold up with flight 6475 from SLC to DEN??
@united DEN-PHX flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted. Asked for overnight 2nite in LAX/SNA. Told not without paying. That's wrong
@united Yeah that didn't happen!
@united Why do I still not have my bags? They arrived @10AM &amp;website says they're still at the airport..2 1/2 hours Late Flightr???!! #nothappy
@United had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won't even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really.
@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
@united no announcement re extra baggage, "find an empty bin" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing
@united bags arrived - I sure miss the customer focused days when I used to fly @ContinentalAir1 Here's hoping @united wakes up
@united Total BS.have 1st class seats for connecting flight. Your crew Late Flight. We miss connection. Had next plane. Yet u don't honor it??
.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage
fuck you, @united and your shitty fucking information http://t.co/scQUjbvsTA
@united on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites
@United come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog
@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins
@united I'm strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines
@united your website won't allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties**
@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the "inflight wifi" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines
@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
@united Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15.
@united @baldordash Rebooked,arrived 8 hours Late Flightr.  Last year 9 hrs to San Diego and the no inflight entertainment!
@united lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent
@United site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can't even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time.  Thanks @United!
@united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks.
@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
@united My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm needing some help reFlight Booking Problems.
@united I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number
@united I'm afraid not... I fly or service every week and I'm just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy
@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable.
@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience
@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
@united your "Airserv" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity.
@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita
@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
@united while busy on his cell phone ???
@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address.
@united: "Left gate 5 minutes early." 
My thoughts: "That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour." #comeonpeople
@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check
@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best
@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.
@united never fails to have delayed flights ðŸ˜¡
@united Yes, myself and about 200 other people also.
@united it's been booked into first class with curbside delivery 24 hours from now. I'm counting on it! #TeamUSA
@united is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks
@united at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees
@united I do I was on UA 495 LAX TO DEN - we are scheduled to land LAX @ 7:38 am - please rebook to Denver - best flight
@united  No first class passenger should have to pay for inflight wifi.
@united my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever
@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks.
@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane "loses its software" I believe you decided to do an upgrade...
@united already missed connection... UA 495
@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say "oh well"
@united Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service.
@united no. U guys suck. I'll never fly with u again. And ur supervisors suck too.
@united on a flight to New York! Love the quality planes on United!! #WTF #crappy #aviation #NewYork http://t.co/zv6CfPoHl5
@united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
@united bad customer service  to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on
@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
@united I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed?
@united @danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can't respond b/c she's alone
@united I was flying home for a 9:30am event tomorrow. You pushed back my flight. Now I have a $400 ticket that won't get me home in time.
@united - you delayed our departure by 2 hrs to wait for passengers from another flight that was Late Flight! Unacceptable!!
@united flight 1136 from Chicago to Houston over 2 hours and no pretzels or peanuts?! Seriously about passed out.
@united - after having to now TAG MY OWN bags at the airport I was hoping they would actually arrive WITH me - here's hoping they arrive
@united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I'm worn out! #EnoughIsEnough
@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
@united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service?
@united She ðŸ‘ won't ðŸ‘ be ðŸ‘ at ðŸ‘ my ðŸ‘ wedding ðŸ‘. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?
@united Brothers luggage was lost on Copa Airlines Flight 635. He's competing Sunday for the 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup. Please help
@united On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy
@United Brothers baggage was lost on route to 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup Championship in Columbia. His race is Sunday. Please help.
@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with "issues"...
@united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.
@united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on?
@united no still trying to get home.
@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?
@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
@united Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return.
@united no u don't
@united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission!
@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off.
@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service
@united Stuck in this airport 12 hours in standbys cuz the pilot showed up Late Flight in PJs &amp; i missed my connectin flight. PJ's I TELL U! #NYFW
@united if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.
@united it most certainly was not.
@united trying to book flight w/miles. Was on hold for 50m before I gave up. Need to get 6 on same flight using two diff # and pay 4 1tix
@united THAT'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you're not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain
@united y not? You're the reason we're in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry.
@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary
@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!
@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours
@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
@united "most likely" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks.
@united tell me something I don't know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea
@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally
â€œ@united: @leigh_emery We don't like to hear this. Is there anything we can help with? Thanks. ^EYâ€ another empty offer for help.
@united I'm try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help?
@united UA7985 is a coshared flight w/ ANA. Unable to check in 24 hrs prior.
@united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.
@united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh
@united where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost
@united assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at?
@united when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together!
@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice
@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
@united I miss the Continental days.
@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!
@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?
@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough
@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information.
@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.
@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar.
@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you "can't do anything" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7
@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
@united you guys suck!
@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.
@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but "unavailable"to book. False advertising much?
@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes "like every 15 minutes." Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?
@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?
@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks
@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the intâ€™l leg, now Iâ€™m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go
@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks
@united Your "Loyalty Team" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google "loyalty" and get back to me? ^LOL
Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks
@united, if you mean beyond opaque "maintenance issues", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage.
@united "Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"
. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
@united not the case. Now delayed due to "mechanical issues with no update on departure time". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta
@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA
@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF
@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE
@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
@united already Flight Booking Problems next week's trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
@united Also, group 5 is total BS.
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100
@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd.
@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
@united worst AIRLINE 
BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN 
BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/
@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, itâ€™s not 1997 anymore.
@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
@united I know. Iâ€™m sure you hear it all the time â€” donâ€™t like the new seats. Iâ€™m a small guy, 5â€™ 6â€ and I feel the new planes are tight
@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
@united delayed another hour
@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable.
@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and iâ€™ll come back.
@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isnâ€™t 1997!
@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo
@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.
@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji
@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
.@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. "But there are rules" says @united
@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.
@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated.
@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.
@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly
@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach
@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!
@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations
.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky
@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day.
@united MIA-EWR #384 ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
@united your customer service is crap.
@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that "slight delay" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation.
@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous
@united actually we aren't. Still parked here.
@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,
@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!
@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?
@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. ðŸ˜’
@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast.
@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA.
@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff
@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?
@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the "broken lightbulb"
@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
@united or I'm sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo
@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!
@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH
@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it.
@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united
@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board.
@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours
@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited
@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that "sandwich."
@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
@united now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k
@united your customer service is terrible
@united please send help ASAP to @KathrynSotelo on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines http://t.co/9sKrLyrZ1O
@united define "appreciate". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback.
@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip.
@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation
@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?
@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
@united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd
@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning "due to operation" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!
@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers
@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an "UNMET ARRIVAL"!!
@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac "waiting for papers"... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !
@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49
@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce
@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?
@united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation
@united  oh united, how much I despise thee!
@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!
@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals
@united how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta
@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep
@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos
@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient
@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
@united its in black and white. EU law and all that â‚¬600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
@united "the extra care airline". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1
@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(
@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines
@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis.
@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful
we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to 1st class. Prebooked? Really? @united: @JenniferWalshPR Your dissatisfaction is und
There were plenty of empty seats in coach "@united: Your dissatisfaction is understood. Crew members traveling for duty are pre-booked on f"
@united all good, didn't die or anything. As they say "you get what you pay for"!
@united your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou
@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet.
@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response
@united  they were empty upon takeoff. Why can't someone sit there?
@united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!
@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
@united â‚¬202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?
@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement.
@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
@united understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm
@united just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ?
@united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I'll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course
@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled
@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family
@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta
@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
@united any solutions?
@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus
@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. ðŸ˜ž
.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
@united it's freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR
@united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn't the crew here#tiredcustomer
@united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?
@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match.
@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.ðŸ˜¡
@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here.
@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
@united playing hide and seek with the gate. "We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."
@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed.
@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X
@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are â‚¬67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff
@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
@united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?
@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
.@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?
@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
@united silence is very telling
@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM
@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
@united 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection
â€œ@united: @RobCNYC See information on our boarding process: http://t.co/gBIw9ugFNm ^KPâ€. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5.
@united Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet.
@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
@united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother
@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
@united How is this considered "on time" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr
@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Contâ€¦
@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail
@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail
@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!
@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.
@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
@united would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
@united service staff to is less than friendly!
@united Can you transfer my bags too?
@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
@united tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done.
@united you had us REBOARD without the captain.  So now we'll be sitting in here for another 20+ min? http://t.co/EEReKDf9Fq
@united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
@united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce
@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
@united smiling? NOT!!
@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!
@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
@united why do you bother surveying me!
@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
@united Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it
@united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service
@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
@united I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call
@united Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. http://t.co/XijYrPsLZK
@united installed and working are not the same. Kicked me out after an hour and wouldn't let me back in. Four wasted hours.
@united that's what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!!
@united so the 4-6hrs that you told me was what? A guess?? They've apparently had the bag 20hrs now and no call.
@united still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can't tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is?
@united seriously? After waiting 2 hours on the plane for my 10:20 flight to leave at 3pm I have to leave the plane? Great. Just great.
@united "We like hearing from you." So why haven't you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi
@united Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something.
@united 1k use to be special.  80 people in group one.   Why not board global AND 1k together? http://t.co/qd2lyUXAZg
@united thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife's 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks
@united As it always is. Helps to communicate to customers.
@united I'm not as sure as you are. http://t.co/HSMpbSF4UF
@united how does that help me with my customers that I couldn't meet with (and subsequently lost)?
@united problem is on laptop not phone
@united question - was given food vouchers but can't use on plane..how   come
@united the wifi in the ewr lounge reminds me of the old days of dial up
@united needs to pay for my car. I could have been on my flight if 4 help desks did not say it already left. Shame.
@united too long for 140 characters
@united Bos-SF was in between waivers. Business Cancelled Flighted due to weather before/after. No flexibility/compassion in extreme circumstances = ðŸ˜”
@united tried that already &amp; tried forgetting the wifi network connection. Still forces log in with incorrect email. Other suggestions?
@united I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi
@united or did you mean 24-26?
@united has it been 4-6hrs yet?
@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
@United does a great job of answering public messages. Direct private messages, not so much.
@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.
@united how's my refund coming along??
@united ANOTHER F*CKING DELAY IN THE PAST 32 HOURS!?
@united 777 from SFO to HNL with ZERO entertainment systems???!!!#youareonyourown
@united how do you log out of wifi in flight? Don't see any option and made typo when logging in. HELP!!
@united flight UA5631 from SFO to Burbank has been delayed twice now. Still no plane in sight. Get it together.
@united Just saying the truth. You don't even an email! #2015
@united MR, she's on her way now, but thought id detail the extravaganza for you... #dobetter #please http://t.co/V8PVpHMtZc
@united we followed the baggage rules on your website and was still charges $150. But only going one way
@united I sent you a dm hours ago
@united Need to track lost luggage being shipped to me. Need ph # for human. Not automated 800-335-2247.
@united no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag
@united nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn't make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks
@united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up!
@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.
@united I'm a minor and freaking out bc I might not make my connecting flight to Hawaii so yes I'm frustrated
@united I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!
@united Case ID 8544484
@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
@united to DM you I have to follow you and I'm not doing that. Plus they're no more options. That's why I had to fly with you. #epicfail
@united - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry
@united of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am
@united @perfectomobile huh?  I have sent 16 crash reports in Feb alone.  8 in one day.  Only app I have that consistently crashes.
@united I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday's flight from Houston to Sao Paulo
@united Contacted yesterday and was told that there's nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service???
@united unfortunately, that doesn't help. Just an automated computer.
@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is.
@united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend theyâ€™re interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
@united I must stop my relationship with you. You've become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over
@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks
@united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
@united whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd...
@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It's STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers.
@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didnâ€™t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. Itâ€™s a dumb delay.
@united need to chat with an actual human ASAP!
@united I got an email saying "changes to my MileagePlus account are confirmed" but I didn't make any changes. Help?
@united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good
@united what a joke. Hang up on customers!!
@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail
@united really hoping to get some help here.  On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers.  help please! #mileageplus
@united I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it's not here yet.
@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
@united That doesnâ€™t make any sense. Iâ€™ve been 1K for over 5 years, and youâ€™re making it harder to keep me loyal.
@united I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she's on 2 days of travel now and we've had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that
@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened
@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?
@united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen.
@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
@united "where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline" #wellplayed #jokesonus
@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
@united Iâ€™ve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?
@united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight....
@united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead
@united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless
@united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
@united sure... You've been saying that for as long as I've been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free.
@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
.@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now.
@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
@united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees.  Random stranger comes up and pays the fee.  #Randomactsofcorporategreed
@united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on
@united thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life.
@united booked a flight yesterday, appeared in my account + confirm email but since a few hours all disappeared and err "no segment in this"
@united no- we are boarding- but why can't your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!!
@united EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated.
@united Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful.
@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.
@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
@united thx. Come hell or high water...
@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho.
@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?
@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!
@united oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like I'll be at least a half day Late Flight to my conference in Santa Monica...
@united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife
@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
@united : Unhappy with United's service?

Read Ralph Nader's open letter to UAL's CEO.

http://t.co/O0745APIau
@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)
@united error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting...
@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldnâ€™t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free.
@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround
@united @staralliance the B gates are very far though
@united UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, &amp; UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels
@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
@united Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help?
@united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take?
@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!
@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your "customer feedback"
@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation.
@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM
@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait.
@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????
@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!
@united you can't claim "weather" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't
@united you're missin the point! There was no "weather". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim "weather" to get out of hotels. Classy
@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
@united final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number
@united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me
@united yes I have
@united #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated
@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx
@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!
@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
@united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
@united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.
@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?
@united My feedback and concerns via your site arenâ€™t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
@united It was quite enjoyable. ðŸ˜Š 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. ðŸ˜•
@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded.
@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ
@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD
@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection.
@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am
@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy
@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
@united flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help
@united correct date is 2/11/15!
@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats.
@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to "fix" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane
@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
@united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to....
@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
â€œ@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JTâ€ A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one.
@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?
@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united
@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed.
@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there.
@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
@united Is your company motto: "I do not care!!!"  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week."  #idonotcare
@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466
@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened "do you want to get to SF today" #fail
@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!
@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened
@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?
@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter.
@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer.
@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found.
@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15
@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again
@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow ðŸ˜­
@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight.
@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesnâ€™t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M).
@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience
@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
@united Nice "partners" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R
@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help.
@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?
@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles?
@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ
@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United "coworkers" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great.
@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense.
@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible "policies".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now.
@united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems
@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way
2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies
1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?
@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA
@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.
@united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
@united its ridic you cant transfer credit, you have my $400 &amp; youre taking $200 of it for Cancelled Flightling. Atleast let me keep the credit damn
@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
@united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP
@united - with airport self checkin your only option I'm now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap.
@united on your website it says 10 days. Its been 16 and counting.
@united the lack of customer service is astounding https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu #2daysofhell
@united my bag is a few days Late Flight to me and this is like the 3rd time in the past couple months.  Where my free miles at?!
@united of course but they were just as helpless as everyone else .
@united 65 and 72 year old flying to Tokyo for vacation both with bad knees and this happens https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu @cbcallinaday @CBCNews
@united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
@united yes, I know that. The question is "why is that still the case"? #fail
@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX
@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united
@united perhaps you could fix this? https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu and this https://t.co/901HLNgBtX #answerthis
@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
@united JH: going to process my refund for wifi. its asking for a receipt #? I never received an email- you guys just whacked my credit card
.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
.@united Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don't cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies
@united But why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with earned "confirmed" certificates?
@united worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts &amp; still didn't make an announcement
@united Can we get Any (free) upgrade because all the problems we've had? Our reservation is MKWLKR.
@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
@united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great!
@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline.
@united we have been told that it's lost...you guys don't know where it is
.@united: Just landed. A day Late Flight with almost no sleep, but here. I feel sorry for the woman I consoled who's mother died during the night.
@united Disappointed,UNITED did NOT feed small CHILDREN on a 5 &amp; half hour flight (Honolulu to Los Angeles), Appalling, ESP food waspaid for
@united Filled out at the airport as part of a long day made longer.
@united UA6255 delayed out of #winnipeg because the plane was "frozen"! #fail Will I make my connection on UA1059? #tightconnection #Denver
@united  delayed about 8 hours because of missed connections due to mechanical issues on 1st flight. rebooked, but please call me 9148445695
. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?
@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT.
@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would.
@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell.
@united we are never going to get to out gate at this rate.
@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.
@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
@united -LGA-ORD UA 711. Did not get agent name. Argument over baggage policy.
@united yes staff were rude  and unempathetic. I needed jacket and tablet by 4 got at 11. If u take carryons cause plane full.don't lose em!
@united Monday evening.
@United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful.
@united my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now
@united if you're listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times!
@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
@united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!
@united why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating
@United what the...? I go into the "all airlines lounge" w/ my Star Alliance Club Card in BCN only to be told Star Alliance isn't accepted
@united Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines
@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- shoddy customer service. Of no use whatsoever. #unitedairline
@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-------- do not reply to emails?
@united it has now been 16 days since i applied for my compensation?

Y have i had no correspondence
@united submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones
@united @laurasbrown5 What does "dealing via email" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices
@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen Next thing you know, United will believe they are above the DOT and take them to court. United is anti-consumer
@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
@united @gg8929 I'm sorry United isn't able to keep its word 'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it's a customer fault!
@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens....
@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
@united how come I have no baggage updates.
@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing
@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?
@united 3 hrs searching for flts, find 1 on site &amp; can't book the $ offered bc 1 seg isn't really available. #lies #falseadvertising
@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday
@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible.
@united unless it's on you guys, im good.
@united are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol
@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way.
@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
@united RTB&gt;IAH 2/17 First class. My wife (Global Services) and I had headaches due to our neighbors smoking e cigarettes. Contact me pls
@united "federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag"...yet you lose our bag and that's okay
@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
@united do you guys have any working planes?
@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you wonâ€™t fix it.
@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)
@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back
@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the "flight more pleasant." http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW
@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude.
@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum
@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!ðŸ˜¢ still no bag!
@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that.
@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result.
@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know
@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?
@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you wonâ€™t fix it?
@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they wonâ€™t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to goâ€¦?
@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
@united how else would I know it was denied?
@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag.
#flyunited
@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
@united I canâ€™t go back to the airport, Iâ€™m working, and wonâ€™t have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?
@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst.
@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff
@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United
@united it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air.
@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out.
@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this.
@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain
@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55.
@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket.
@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5
@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67
@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
@united can you not see the thread?
@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP
@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!
@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united.
@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!
@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
@united Call customer service and of course they just say "theres nothing we can do" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line.
@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks
@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
@united Classic
@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to "fly" united
@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?
@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.
@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!
@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
@united worst service ever ðŸ˜ˆ
@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..ðŸ˜¡...
@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday
@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck
@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed.
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please.
@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
@united customer service ðŸ‘Ž
@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2
@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it.
@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)
@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.
@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years.
@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation
@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
@united you are really trying me today.
@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta
@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
@united who can tell me where they are?
@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.
@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.
@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke
@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus.
@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?
@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem
@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?
@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation.
.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +
@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!
@united's first-class #cockup
http://t.co/oh7CFv7DHR
@united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive!
@united Bad coffee, but the juice is ok. #GetPhilz @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Sg7IQqFVsO
@united why am i mot getting my refund?
.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE
@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless
.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight
@United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on
@united i have items of sentimental value that I'm heartbroken are missing
@united still waiting for a reply
@united please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn't there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!!
Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. @united
@united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why
@united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.
@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion
@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait
@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.
@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!
@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
@SouthwestAir still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care
@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
@SouthwestAir my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason.  Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A
@SouthwestAir my flight was delayed 4 hrs. I'm 5 months pregnant &amp; supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now. Very upset.
@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
@SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
@SouthwestAir Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting
@SouthwestAir can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven't gotten through
@SouthwestAir has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again.
@SouthwestAir oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
@SouthwestAir belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree
@SouthwestAir they were moved to the 210pm flight #4649. Main concern now is luggage arriving with them. They were told that SW was having
@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
@SouthwestAir thx but I'll be expecting a credit for this leg.
@SouthwestAir  appreciate y'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac
@SouthwestAir 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous......
@SouthwestAir have u seen any of the messages the past hour ?
@SouthwestAir went to purchase a flight that I began processing not even 4 minutes earlier and the points had gone up - any help?
@SouthwestAir I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
@SouthwestAir its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won't get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh
@SouthwestAir your phone service sucks
@SouthwestAir are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I'm on...
@SouthwestAir and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail
@SouthwestAir oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane
@SouthwestAir trying to change my reservation, been on hold for 45 minutes, and can't do it online-was directed to call. Help?
@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
@SouthwestAir Yo, I'm trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says, "Unable to price". Please help!
@SouthwestAir great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir had to let us off the plane bc the toilets done even work! There goes my family vacay to playa del Carmen, Mexico! #neveragain
@SouthwestAir thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest.
@SouthwestAir I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds.
@SouthwestAir @SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok.
@SouthwestAir horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ
@SouthwestAir yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again.
@SouthwestAir need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL
@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch
@SouthwestAir I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what's up with that?
@SouthwestAir then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal
@SouthwestAir was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2
@SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points?
@SouthwestAir Rapid Rewards program sold me short. #Lasttweetaboutthis but still #disappointed.
@SouthwestAir freezing in the plane
@SouthwestAir where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are
@SouthwestAir from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon
@SouthwestAir flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us
@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
@SouthwestAir u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable
@SouthwestAir do you know that your lost baggage portal http://t.co/hUcLXluV5h doesn't work on mobile? It's a 404 http://t.co/O4ZR27Qpcr
@SouthwestAir if you're going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn't take the length of the flight to open a page
@SouthwestAir your website has now reverted my 1st flight to only a 5-minute delay. But it's changed, so is that reliable information?
@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.
@SouthwestAir unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED
@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
@SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go?
@SouthwestAir and thx for not responding
@SouthwestAir I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that?
@SouthwestAir Supposed to take off almost 2 hours ago....#vacationfail #frozenwater? #gettingimpatient #theycouldatleastofferfreebooze
@SouthwestAir how come I'm not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site?
@SouthwestAir mins and no answer. My wife and baby need to get on that flight. She arrived 2 hrs prior. Please help. Venetia Crook

@SouthwestAir flight 1614 FLL to ATL. My wife traveling with infant. Line to check baggage 200 people long due to your computer system crash
@SouthwestAir Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed?
@SouthwestAir LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can't be the only one with this issue on flight 1625
@SouthwestAir INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing.
@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?
@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
@SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
@SouthwestAir I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir: #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed
@SouthwestAir Is there a way to receive a refund on a trip that was Cancelled Flight online instead of calling? Your phone lines are super busy.
@SouthwestAir Switching planes due to mechanical problems.  How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line.  Stuck in middle?
@SouthwestAir Why, when I booked via phone after calling the A List preferred #, didn't my KTA get added to the ticket??? Must I use web?
@SouthwestAir: Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone.
@SouthwestAir why was Southwest only airline to Cancelled Flight all flights from Charleston? Was 7:50pm flight Cancelled Flightation really weather reLate Flightd?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? http://t.co/aaU9MKA6Zy
@SouthwestAir I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX!
@SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees
@SouthwestAir would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation
@SouthwestAir why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?!
@SouthwestAir   I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket http://t.co/forNpF69Ky
@SouthwestAir I "heart" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations.
@SouthwestAir Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate.
@SouthwestAir can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay
@SouthwestAir my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn't get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS!
@SouthwestAir no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight.
@SouthwestAir weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can't because meeting was today.
@SouthwestAir when and why was flight 4471 from MSP Cancelled Flighted this AM?
@SouthwestAir I luv y'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna.
@SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes
@SouthwestAir give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers
@SouthwestAir it's just the principle - it's hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn't give me anything #wrongiswrong
@SouthwestAir customer service you shouldn't use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft http://t.co/63zaQ2lt8f
@SouthwestAir three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems
@SouthwestAir I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me
@SouthwestAir customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear
@SouthwestAir After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night.
@SouthwestAir up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might "know" but don't show it.
@SouthwestAir darn! I bought it on the wrong device! No way to switch I'm sure?
@SouthwestAir hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. 

#filmjobnoequipment 
#nowarmclothes
@SouthwestAir you need to redeem yourself. I lost respect for you tonight #lostbags #filmjobnoequipment
@SouthwestAir way to fuck up and lose @c_istudios bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool
@SouthwestAir wifi stays connected about the lifetime of a higgs boson
@SouthwestAir When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international?
@SouthwestAir making me miss #TheBachelor right now #wah
@SouthwestAir we can let #bags flutter because we charge travelers that had to change dates #fullprice and we don't let them travel
@SouthwestAir won't let me send a DM because they don't follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy
@SouthwestAir your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane.
@SouthwestAir has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked
@SouthwestAir here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up.
@SouthwestAir Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all!
@SouthwestAir disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your customer service right now. definitely not feeling the luv. what's worse, 2nd time this winter.
@SouthwestAir Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ
@SouthwestAir when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service
@SouthwestAir Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin
@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
@SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
@SouthwestAir : This is the second time in a row I haven't received text updates about flight time change. Don't offer if you won't use it
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
@SouthwestAir @TaylorLumsden Taylor.  U gotta love SWA responsiveness at the@very least huh?
@SouthwestAir NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight
@SouthwestAir oh, ok!  all good!  looking forward to escaping the cold for a bit!  thanks!
@SouthwestAir wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can't get on the Internet?! Ugh...
@SouthwestAir hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
@SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights.
@SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and don't see any albums.
@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule.
@SouthwestAir u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/
@SouthwestAir prove it
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
@SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.
@SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7
@SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.
@SouthwestAir sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action.
@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?
@SouthwestAir how about #destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since I am not there to play scavenger hunt?
@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding
@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
@SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can't load an email.
@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
@SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?
@SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions
@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????
@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
@SouthwestAir weren't too "sincere" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home..
@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip
@SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?
@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
@SouthwestAir yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting.
@SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable
@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
@SouthwestAir delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy
@SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@SouthwestAir  how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ?
@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?
@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
@SouthwestAir I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat?
@SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail
@SouthwestAir my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. @RnCahill  Please contact her.
@SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours.
@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
@SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
@SouthwestAir Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help!
@SouthwestAir I did. Still haven't heard a thing.
@SouthwestAir I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' .....
@SouthwestAir @LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040
@SouthwestAir Password reset email is incredibly slow to arrive today. Checked spam folder, too. Web site says a few minutes, but 15? :|
@SouthwestAir I've had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don't care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon
@SouthwestAir on hold for 15+ min...no estimated answer time. Any help here?
@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
@SouthwestAir What's up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I've been on for over 15 min.
@SouthwestAir flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight
@SouthwestAir bag in possession but no clothes in bag??
@SouthwestAir, you're really going to let @delta and @virginamerica get the best of you? http://t.co/vUdWJm1lYB
@SouthwestAir Please get back with my about my airtran credit Q4VNMB, I call and I'm being told that I will, but I never get email/call back
@SouthwestAir pleaseeee resume direct flights from FLL to PHL. I don't want to fly with anyone else ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜¢
@SouthwestAir what to do when you show up to your destination with no clothes in your suitcase? #nakedmeetings #awkward
@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?
@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out.
@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir how about fixing the wifi!  3rd flight where it's not working. 800 series plane so not like it's an old plane.
@SouthwestAir #1687 MDW-SAN. Like most flights, if I'm watching free TV it works but won't hardly access any websites - including your own.
@SouthwestAir almost at the gate for 1156 to SF. Please wait 60 more seconds.
@SouthwestAir RT @kkwhb: Paid for early bird boarding and got B46.  I said to lady, "well, that system is about dead." She didn't understand
@SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
@SouthwestAir my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don't even know where it is, Please help.
@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
@SouthwestAir thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight, last minute of course, to #GIS2015. I'm now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this!
@SouthwestAir you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.)
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx
@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys ðŸ’”ðŸ˜ª
@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
@SouthwestAir It was never really "lost" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!
@SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest
@SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040
@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
.@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, itâ€™ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service
@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink ðŸ˜•
@SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
@SouthwestAir thank you : 8UXZJ2
Paid for early bird and sat in back
@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country.
@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?
@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy ðŸ˜£
@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
@SouthwestAir please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again
@SouthwestAir no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar.
But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for "weather."  We flew home on weatherless @united.
@SouthwestAir really shouldn't offer sweeps if your link isn't going to work! B http://t.co/nOfG0TQHYN
@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?
@SouthwestAir WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn't lit $24 on fire
@SouthwestAir everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again!
@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
@southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can't load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir You've inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit
@SouthwestAir everyones flights who were Cancelled Flightled today DESERVE 1
@SouthwestAir How about auto check in for CP holders? Come on.
@SouthwestAir wifi is the worst $8 investment I have ever made.
@SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting
@SouthwestAir couldn't be bothered to help with my lost my luggage. Not a single helpful employee owner to be found in BWI.
@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous
@SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag.
@SouthwestAir I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven't received it.
@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
@SouthwestAir I'm gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!!
@SouthwestAir I'm a huge fan and give y'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi!
@SouthwestAir  we understand air delays which are out of your control, terrible telephone support, apps and online access that do not work??
@SouthwestAir now I can't board thanks. You guys moved me to standby. I've been holding this boarding pass since 7pm yesterday
@SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained
@SouthwestAir been sleeping on the floor like I'm homeless and now delayed flights because the equipment isn't working! I have a job to get2
@SouthwestAir you guys should stop doing service in Denver it's horrible I get stuck here every time! I've been here almost 24hrs
@SouthwestAir Had a very unpleasant experience over the phone with one of your agents re: a Cancelled Flightled flight. I have the name &amp; agent ID.
@SouthwestAir your wifi is angering me with its slowness
@SouthwestAir we've been at the gate a long time. We're gonna miss our connection at MDW. Ack! http://t.co/qRXvZFrD1Z
@SouthwestAir Sort of, but I'm arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all...
@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?
@SouthwestAir just sent it
@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
@SouthwestAir baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler
@SouthwestAir most other carriers were flying out way past SW Cancelled Flightlation. @AlaskaAir and @JetBlue got their passengers out much Late Flightr!!!!!
@SouthwestAir extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it's Monday afternoon!
@SouthwestAir I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service!
@SouthwestAir your "complimentary" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!
@SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped
@SouthwestAir you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr!
@SouthwestAir my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What's the process for damage reimbursement?
@SouthwestAir ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed
@SouthwestAir - thanks for Cancelled Flighting our flight to BOS. We're stranded in DEN til Wed night. The 7 of us will never fly #southwest again
@SouthwestAir I was trying to find airfare for my family.  Your prices are ridiculous!  Almost $1000 more than @USAirways. #notmadeofmoney
@SouthwestAir our flight is delayed till tomorrow curse the weather
@SouthwestAir now I'm so lucky for my forced good deed I get to be smashed between 2 huge ppl in the exit row. Thank God I'm tiny. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’
@SouthwestAir BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn't zoom out or scroll to touch "Buy"
@SouthwestAir it was not - still don't know where skis are and cannot get a call back from bag svc at airport (left several msgs)
@SouthwestAir wife's flight to DAL just got Cancelled Flightled. What does she do to find options to get back home?  1708 PHX-&gt;DAL

@SouthwestAir Flight 52 got Cancelled Flightled 6 hrs before takeoff. No Customer Service. Been on hold for 30 minutes.
@SouthwestAir waiting over a half hour for my checked baggage to be delivered! No updates from any ground crew
@SouthwestAir    Promotion e-mail today (Vegas and Jamaica) has a defective link for the Vegas sweepstakes...it times out with error.
@SouthwestAir No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss
@SouthwestAir As a frequent traveler, I've never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove
@SouthwestAir - neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers, right? http://t.co/vn3JJIa53O
@SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI
@SouthwestAir Totally ruined my birthday weekend by Cancelled Flighting my flights for no reason and offer no points, drink, transport. #nolove #cali
@SouthwestAir What's happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali
@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
@SouthwestAir we didn't nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can't change into clean clothes
@SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?
@SouthwestAir I have never had such awful customer service and conflicting service. Outrageous.
@SouthwestAir no I wasn't. After over an hour was too frustrated and had to hang up.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can't find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE.
@SouthwestAir fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile. The link auto changes on mobile. Desktop works fine.
@SouthwestAir @AARP @JimCramer 75yo mom says, "Hire more staff to accommodate your audience" You could learn lots from her. She's off to FL
@SouthwestAir I was never able to talk so someone so had to buy another new ticket. Will be calling shortly for refund.
