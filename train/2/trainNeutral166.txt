"There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons –
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes –

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –
We can find no scar,
But internal difference –
Where the Meanings, are –"

@mrdaps NOTE: #HongKongDisneyland says the Park will close but the Resort Hotels will remain open. Will that change? Don't know. But that's the message on #HKDisneyland website @DrDenaGrayson #CoronaOutbreak #WuhanVirus #CoronavirusOutbreak @drsanjaygupta https://t.co/JX8XSIVGYv
Sword or shield
@aa9skillz This patch is ass bro, some passing lanes have changed, also whenever I switch play with FULL POWER my guy just dinks it to the guy 3 yards from me🧐 wtf is that? I’ve also noticed lobbed through balls register as normal through balls sometimes. https://t.co/L6PJXwlgtF
INTERESTING: "Note: Error in situation reports published on 23,24 and 25 January as originally published, which incorrectly summarized the risk for global level to be MODERATE." (Risk rating at global level now HIGH!)

@Thought4rce @Rightoyeahnar @devalara44 @abcnews @walabor @RogerCookMLA @ScottMorrisonMP @vanOnselenP @kagij BBC also reporting virus has been around since December so plenty of time for the iron ore crews and the FIFO chinese workers to get to the Pilbara.

Reading my @BostonGlobe with the front page story on deadly ecoli in romaine lettuce followed by interior story on Wuhan virus coming from eating animals and wondering: what the hell is safe to have for breakfast?
What about dormancy on surfaces?
Is it's resistance to heat, cold?
Are aircraft's being fully decontaminated, or airports, their air-conditioning systems?
Too many questions and no answers.
