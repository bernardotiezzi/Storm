Isaac Hayes‚Äô performance of By The Time I Get to Phoenix has a semi-spoken intro providing a back story that puts a different slant on the song. Great song. Writer Jimmy Webb stated the song wasn‚Äôt meant to be ‚Äògeographically literal‚Äô üòÅ https://t.co/tENX6Luou9 https://t.co/eatDdNBbi8
@BroadfieldJon @heckmannyy @HotesRenee @Abulinixish @SoldByWendy @_ReaalAmerican_ @greg_price11 In 2014-15 flu season the CDC estimates 34 million Americans got the flu, 710,000 were hospitalized and about 56,000 died. 
     If President Trump is responsible for the Wuhan virus Obama was guilty of killing 56,000 people.
Or do you have double standards.

Every single day President Trump and VP Mike Pence address the nation and brief them on a variety of topics related to the CHINESE Virus.

We have never seen such clear and constant communication from the White House during a time of crisis.

Thank GOD we have a wartime POTUS.
@LenLavie His free hand takes an ample fistful of Keith‚Äôs ass cheek and squeezes hard, returning one of the nips by pulling Keith‚Äôs lower lip and feels his body rocked by a deep shiver. 

‚ÄúNnh, I‚Äôve wanted ‚Äî to do that for years,‚Äù his fingers knead in the muscle, his mouth a pleased slant.

Students from the North-East who went to a super market were denied entry in Mysuru

This is the effect of using racist de-humanising terms like 'Chinese Virus'

Citizens from NE will face further discrimination. Strict action should be taken to stop this.

@LekisRa1der Terry can hit below ledge with PG on slants, just FYI. Ganon players are generally comfortable holding the ledge, but it's mad dangerous.

Also, Terry will stick his leg straight out if you dsmash on a slant, so it can mitigate quite a few ledge camp options done properly.
