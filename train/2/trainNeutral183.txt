@joe_warmington @JohnTory john Tory is very troubled by everything but the things he should be troubled by ... like criminal gangs and gun crime. Viruses dont care about being PC nor do they care about feelings ... the virus is of chinese origin thats just a fact...even canadian chinese people are afraid

The period between exposure to the new coronavirus that originated in China and symptoms is 5.2 days on average, but varies greatly among patients, according to one of the largest studies yet published.

Recommendation #15.

Contemporary events were already in the curriculum. And graduates are required to take Social up to grade 12.

This one feels like the curriculum will become more prescriptive on which specific events to teach - but obviously with no political slant/ideology. https://t.co/MnBgdhtJGM
