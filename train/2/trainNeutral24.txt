#5 here is being asked to cover a slot receiver as a rush LB. Token ball fake gets #4 to bite and open up the passing lane, while HB runs a skinny post/slant. Made possible by the Y receiver trying to win an Oscar selling the deep threat. Pull #3 away from the HB, big play.

@JohnSimpsonNews I've been there twice, and to Dachau. Also, I went to Buchenwald before and after the fall of the DDR. The slant put on it in 1981 was very different to that in 2003.

@CHARleeTrauma @brianstelter Coronavirus is a term for a family of viruses, no-name because of the crown-like spikes on their surface.

Wuhan Virus has been commonly used across pretty much every major publication and follows very common geographic naming convention for pandemics. https://t.co/ijaYZPSHwG
