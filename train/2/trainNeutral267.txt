@gillradcliffe @paganwick @ChanclaForceOne @dominiquetaegon @CABennett_Oxon The views and experiences if younger people is that calling this the "Chinese Virus" is harmful to asian immigrants and asian americans throughout the country.

Saying that what you're saying is harmful is not disrespectful. Continuing to say it when it harms people is.

@MajorPoonia He had mentioned in an interview that he was shaking hands with patients when he visited a hospital #ChinaVirus #WuhanVirus #ChineseVirus19 #XijinpingVirus #ChinaLiedPeopleDied
A batch of 37, just-returned from Mecca, erased their quarantine stamp, dodged further security & mingled freely.

Yet if someone says "avoid contact with ALL peacefuls", he'd be called a racist.
But u have to be safe.

@WesternRly @Gmwrly Railways should consider providing Medical assistance to Retired employees too who are getting Medial allowance as it is difficult to get medical assitance with Private doctors and Hospitals till the Chinese Virus stops.
Split Zone is a great play meant to look like Zone Read to freeze the defensive end for a kick-out block from the tight end or fullback. @justplayfb https://t.co/uRmnYNDhlL Visit them in #AFCA2020 Booth 445. Right by the Skills & Drills field. https://t.co/lRmcCN3Ldb
@DecMonaghan01 @ElaineYoung94 I am so worried (this side of the pond) that there could be a massive rightward swing. The groundwork is already being laid for blaming immigrants by calling it the Chinese Virus. When the health care system is overwhelmed they will blame it on undocumented people
Affected by campus shutdowns overseas, many of the 600,000-plus students are returning home because they have nowhere else to go. Yet, returnees have been criticised on social media for bringing the virus back to China. @tianyuf for @SCMPNews https://t.co/Dh0Mfefnno https://t.co/86fkbbj9Ae
Coronavirus cruise ship allowed to dock at Fremantle after second medical emergency https://t.co/shunzbBLex via @ABCNews
 So the stupid people who took cruises in late February & in March are putting all of Australianâ€™s at risk of Wuhan virus. 
Mind numbing really do they listen
@JamesHarkin Have you read David Markson's THIS IS NOT A NOVEL series? I caught two facts from back-to-back recent episodes that featured facts I learned from his books. Co-inky-dink?
@Swamy39 Also GOI can tie up with Oyo rooms to accommodate them freely at the cost of GOI in case trains are not running. They can be kept in rooms and be tested for Wuhan Virus sort of signs if any. Or shipping line containers can be used to accommodate with temp elec fan n lamp be given

Govt should clearly mark areas/districts Green, Amber or Red to  open up or act strict during present
 curfew. Green zones can begin process of normalising life, releasing resources for use in amber & red areas. Normalisation process will be systematic.

2) coastal RE bubble collapses next. Then Tax rev decline hits overstretched municipal budgets forcing public sector layoffs if not outright defaults. California itself then defaults. 

Cali if ground 0 for #CCPVirus depression!

@StephenGlassEdD @atensnut @realDonaldTrump Beginning meaning when the Chinese scientists, whoâ€™ve since disappeared, spilled the beans about this virus, thatâ€™s when. All youâ€™re out to do is bash Trump, thatâ€™s all youâ€™re doing.. a little campaigning for your nutty political party that doesnâ€™t really have a direction.
@jennybeansbooks @Inevitable_ET Years later I was at a party. I found out that a neighbor actually saw me on his way home and wondered what the heck was going on! Always wondered why those socks were wet and dirty. And that was the Russian flu. #ChinaVirus
