@DisChimera @thespybrief @AE1TT @DrDenaGrayson @911CORLEBRA777 @tenaciousN @Elyrya_Ylnae @wokyleeks Acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site and O-linked glycans in influenza hemagluttinin converts harmless avian influenza into a highly pathogenic human virus. Chinese WET MARKETS are an ideal site for this happening. Apparently, same happened with this coronavirus.

I bought an air mask in case the smoke from the British Columbia fires got really bad. Never needed but if the Wuhan virus gets here... just might be the best $100 investment I ever made. https://t.co/vX9KMn4I3F
@SolomonYue @realDonladTrump @VP @SecPompeo @RepJimBanks @JanJekielek Does the debt even enough to cover the losses incurred by the CCP Virus in the US? However, it is a... novel idea
A rapid rise of U.S dollar üíµ can be double whammy for emerging markets where business borrow heavily in U.S dollar and dependent on exports of commodities that prices in dollar.

@runbaja20 @RyanKJames @TheFredGood @josephtanst @Crisis_x2 @LowStakesDaniel @alx @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @washingtonpost No, you are lost, if there was not an official name, why were you expecting media to decide what to call it? Now there is a name, so why is POTUS calling it the chinese virus? WHO states: having a name matters to prevent use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.
@minhtgum Nah bro striker and wizard are even more just one combo. Other classes do like 2-3
@zlj517 #COVID19 While the impact of flu varies, In the United States each year. CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million ‚Äì 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 ‚Äì 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 ‚Äì 61,000 deaths annually since 2010. (Before Wuhan Virus)
@RosenDustin @LowStakesDaniel @alex_jpgr @r2romasanta @josargent20 @Expertzero @alx @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @washingtonpost To an extent that when he announced that he will ensure that no businesses will cut wages etc because of the Chinese Virus, the foolish people attacked him for calling it Chinese infrared if thanking him for the initiative. What will these morons do if axed? Ask Xi?
