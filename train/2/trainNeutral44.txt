Those complaining about having their kids at home due to the school closures have clearly never had to put up with a snoring chonky cat right behind your ear when trying to make a phone call. https://t.co/EOA3HXqRAb
@stefondiggs The extra work that‚Äôs on you and not the QB. The yards after catch just being a playmaker period. Turning that 5 yard slant into a 40 yard gain. Turning that tackle in the backfield on that bubble screen into a first down

I also added Rubik Italic to the stack to upgrade my faux-italics. That feels great too. It's only loaded if I use italicized text because CSS is smart.

Will try to blog all this at some point. And if you have geometric sans variable font w/ both wght and slant axes recs, lmk.

@PrayerWallDiva @EugeneCho Coronavirus is named for the crown like structure on the surface of the virus. Coronavirus is a type of virus that has been around since the 1960s. There are 7 types of coronaviruses that can infect humans. 
The ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù is an unhelpful name due to lack of specificity
My hairline really doing slant routes rnüò≠ I need a cut
@SpreadOffense Saw a play similar to this in a game the other day. 2 WRs on the right create a fake rub, outside guy then breaks into a fade, inside guy breaks slant towards the middle. Get DBs with confused hips, fade has space to catch and run.

I‚Äôm new to this, so any feedback is welcome. https://t.co/AGZe57eq7g
