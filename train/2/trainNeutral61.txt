@Trehff @MidnightTokr @melissarn15 @KatCantAnymore @prince_carie @AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump The virus has an actual name- COVID-19 (which stands for Corona Virus of 2019, officially). since it has an actual name, the only reason to call it Chinese Virus is bigotry and bias. And those Chinese Americans would likely not be under attack without these seeds being sown.

@GadSaad @VanessaHudgens Wait till July comes.

As GR Elton once noted, "Events once in the distant future soon become the past".

July to come will soon enough be the past and I fear we will still be enduring the Chinese virus.

@Bungo20816364 @christopherhope Brexit agreement is a negligible drop in the ocean by comparison to the cost both in human and financial terms of getting the response to the Chinese virus even a tiny bit wring. Surely you can see that.
