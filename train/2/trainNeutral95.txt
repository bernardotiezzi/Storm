@CavazosLiz @ChristieLeeEMT @meredithmusing @BarbaraLedeen @JaredHuffman @SenTomCotton Context2:  SpanishFlu, Ebola, MERS ('ME'=Middle East), etc. all named after where it started.

Why avoid "Wuhan virus" and go out of our way to call it "Coronavirus" (misleading - common cold, SARS also are coronaviruses) or "COVID-19" (w/0 googling, what does COVID even mean)?

In the aftermath of the devastating Narok Town floods of 2015, a rapid impact assessment showed youth and women suffered terribly losses because they mostly operated SMEs and many policies were blind to this segment including their safety nets. Covid-19KE will expose same chinks
@oritokeagbaje @bluegirlolu Slant position ðŸ˜€
IN the days of old there were WALLS around villages TO PROTECT the people from invaders and disease from outsiders, from plagues.  Invaders would throw dead infected bodies over the walls to infect people with plagues.  YES WE NEED BORDERS, WALLS TO PROTECT FROM  #WuhanVirus https://t.co/i5mCRdugpO
@thedylanesque @Eduarpack @OfficialJMQ @NehiMomma @DavMicRot @GOPLeader Government officials have a responsibility to tell people where the virus outbreak to be. So there is nothing wrong with calling it a Chinese virus. Don't use racism. Trump is not a medical professional

@andrew_lilico Base times height to get area for both square and rhombus. 
In square, height is the same as the base as all sides at right angles. As sides the same length, length squared is the same as height times base in square. 
In a rhombus it is not, due to the slant of the sides.
