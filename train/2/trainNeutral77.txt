@Aylaraee @kaitlynbrown___ @sydnem23 Coronavirus is actually a basic name for multiple strands of bacterial infections. Someone can be diagnosed with a coronavirus and it more than likely be SARS or MERS instead of this CORVID-19 that‚Äôs going around. The Wuhan virus is completely different than what we‚Äôve had before
@BrandonBeckham_ @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @JoeBiden Travel RESTRICTIONS after 300,000 Chinese came into the country is rather like closing the barn door after the horses get out. The virus was already here. Citizens & family are allowed to go back & forth from China. IT‚ÄôS NOT A BAN. @realDonaldTrump is a COMPLETE FAILURE!
