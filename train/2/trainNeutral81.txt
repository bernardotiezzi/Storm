Over the next immediate days STAY HOME until we have better direction on coming changes.... ITS URGENT OR THE WORLD WOULD NOT BE CLOSED. WE ARE IN A WAR. AND ITS NOT JUST A CORONA VIRUS. 
ITS A CHINESE VIRUS.

03/17/2020, after 3000~ down in DJIA, clawed back 1000~ today, still 25% down from the highest in February. President Trump's calling "Chinese Virus" will draw violent actions against Chinese Americans, so irresponsible. Lijian Zhao's tweet is stupid, but no hyper-correction.

There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons â€“
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes â€“

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us â€“
We can find no scar,
But internal difference â€“
Where the Meanings, are â€“

@KittenDadSr @JWTyler4USRep @l0bst3rtweet @kt_kymdoc @dtbechtol @heckyessica @DutyOfAPatriot @SenSchumer The democrats are not helping they spend 4 days negotiating a package that included stimulus for people and companies,then ran away to play politics. Union rights and solar energy has nothing to do with the Wuhan virus. Democrats dont seem to realize that!!!
@Walmart please consider future implementation of: "Emergency directive a(1)":  Select Walmart stores open until 12:30 a.m. where peak Wuhan virus outbreaks occur, to reduce overcrowding - i.e. reduce spread of virus.
'Directive a': Public to minimize large gatherings/clusters.
