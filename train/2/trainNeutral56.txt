@RandPaul @RepAdamSchiff Lets do some comparisons.  Notice how the lowercase D hooks to the left at the top, how angular the lowercase V is, forced slant to the letters... Both of these were written by a left-handed person.  Adam Schiff is right-handed, but you aren't are you? https://t.co/dnjOLeUG1l

The age of 18 I could afford to go out every Friday, Saturday sometimes a Thursday, bought new clothes every weekend and go 2 holidays a year. I am now on double what I earn and I am lucky if I can afford one night out and a chinky a month.😂😂 Adulting sucks
𝒿-𝒽𝑜𝑜𝑜𝓅𝑒:
font is very different: cursive is considered more humanistic, proud, formal
width differences in lines
writing slant determines the degree of emotional expression, shows desire to act

@abellehayford I like how the designs on the sleeves reflect their powers. 'Slant away'=offensive/'Slant inward'=defensive. Also the original colors fading into another color is like sunrise and sunset!

Today’s @Telegraph columnists’ opinions show the considered value of print media: @Madz_Grant on middle class righteousness, Philip Johnston on cure v problem and Con Coughlin on the Chinese’ virus hypocrisy
@Trompetteherr @RyherdPhyllis @Dewestmusic243 @LeBonTravel Always a storm after the calm.  However, with our leftist/socialist , anti-Trump media there is never a calm anywhere on any level, not even in re to the Chinese Virus.  So, enjoy your calm if you can.
@RaleighHeekin @kiley_christina @eojnusko @MSJRedlands @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Where did I say or imply that we should treat Asian people differently? I said Trump should NOT call it Chinese virus but also we shouldn’t ignore where the breakout occurred so we can learn and be better prepared. Y’all Trump haters can’t help but try and put words in my mouth
