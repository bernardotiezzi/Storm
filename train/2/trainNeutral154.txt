@GeigerNews The slant is minor .
@OT_ThreshFPS Or when you get no sheild off spawn and have to go into mid game and a controller player from a mile away sees you and double dinks you with a scar

LSU spaces receivers and runs fake arrow slant. Turns into a spray slant. Saw Defenders did not switch so came back next snap with arrow/slant rub. Defender played over rub and broke in front of slant. https://t.co/hQv8SpxqtF
We'll likely look back at the 2010s as a simpler time, when sea levels remained relatively stable, Disney hadn’t decimated the last remaining movie houses, and there were only three networks: Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu.  https://t.co/gbPWd935QG
Who likes healthcare stock better than those nearing or in retirement. Capital preservation, some value appreciation and income generation. What's not to like? My latest @MorningstarCDA checks the pulse of 4 healthcare stocks. https://t.co/H0onjmh8lP  #stocks #invest #WuhanVirus
@The_Coach_A @CoachVass @MDGAPodcast high but when we get a double team it means we have a free runner or a qb players.  We disguise our fronts, very similar to what you described, align over, slant to under. 

I really enjoyed the podcast because I do think 1vs2 high get to the same point but the route we take 2/x
I have forgotten what to wear to after-work dates so I’m dressed like business-casual 90s grunge cutie (little floral dress, chonky boots, leather jacket). Sadly this means I’m also freezing my chonky tittehs off.
@slade248 @CoachAdamGaylor When he folds, what tells you whether to throw the Slant or the arrow?
controller players after they triple dink you from across the map https://t.co/15bE6oC074

@AprilSmithBooks The global economic impact from the loss of tourism, consumer spending, and supply chain from now closed or reduced Chinese factories will be huge. In Singapore last week that was the focus, more than the virus itself.
@TeamXStreamFB @slade248 Movement key of LB blitz called for the hot throw to the slant pattern that was running to uncapped space. QB understands that the Defense is playing man free. His rule is to throw the hot route off of the blitz.
