@CoachEndersRMHS @425DC1 I agree.  I run a 3-4 so I have my corners butt to sideline at 7 so they can not only see Run/Pass but also what 2 and 3 are doing.  Sometimes 3 runs a corner on us so it helps big time.  We will mix in press but never in cover 3. Helps to have OLB near by to help with slant/flat

@jessesheidlower There appears to be a lag. I keep getting notices that I look like a good match for a job opening at a travel-related business. 
I also unsubscribed from a quirky and famous hand-tool dealer who sent out a note that read in part "no kungflu or hysteria here."
@MollyJongFast He seems to look at things calmly with an intellectual slant.

@Anthony_TBT_OC Clemson gives a salt call. Automatic slant flat & the back blocks the Nickel
@MuslimIntifada @sahelsheriff003 @RanaAyyub Also, every citizen is paying for freebies as towards taxes,..if govt is not able to reach the needy at this time, like A/B type NCOVID-19 #WuhanVirus, then it is actually spending wrong. Over time, you get kits in market to check by yourself to remove the doubt.
