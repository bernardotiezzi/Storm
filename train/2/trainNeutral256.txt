@cov_Gretchen 1 in 700,000 hit by lightning every year. At this rate you have a better chance of being hit by lightning than dying from the chinese virus. You have a better chance of being hit by lightening not once, not twice but three times!
@thehill Spanish Flu 
Chinese Virus 
African Ebola
@brenthatley Hey Brent I'm a trucker hopefully going to be able to get back home to Illinois from Texas. Before our asshole governments shut us down and keep me from my family for 2 weeks when I have zero symptoms and have not been exposed to anybody with chink disease.
List of things canceled this week:

- May events
- Doorknobs
- Spring breakers
- OANN
- Ppl saying “It’s just like the flu!"
- Senator Kelly Loeffler
- China’s state-sponsored media
- The term “Chinese virus"
- The phrase “closely monitoring”
- Elon Musk

What did I miss?
@kt4liberty Rent payments are supposed to go on hold too. Tax deadline pushed until July, I'm glad the guy who does my taxes is older and I wouldn't want to expose him to any Kung Flu if I'm carrying.

@MarkRuffalo @realDonaldTrump No bad what so ever is meant by referring to these diseases by places of origin. In fact scientist do that until they can pinpoint exactly what the disease is. It was medical scientist  who actually called it the Wuhan virus first.
A jet carrying 359 people including hundreds of American and Canadian #CruiseShip passengers home from #France landed at #Atlanta’s international airport on Friday as emergency responders prepared to screen them for the #CCPVirus, federal officials said. https://t.co/JrcoNrZuhe

It's like I accidentally start the fire in my apt then waste time, then try to extinguish it but fail, then let it spread. 
But refer to it as I "helped" the other tenants who live in my building by delaying the fire. Journos should be ashamed.🤮#coronavirus #ChineseVirus https://t.co/J8XHNaUC2A

A closeup of Donald Trump’s news conference statement Thursday shows where the word “corona” was crossed out and replaced with “Chinese” virus as he speaks to reporters.

A closeup photo from Washington Post photographer Jabin Botsford of the president’s briefing notes revealed in a section where the prepared remarks read, “Corona Virus,” “Corona” was crossed out and “Chinese” was written in its place, in what appeared to be Trump’s handwriting. https://t.co/2ZQqJpAGmL
@LaylaMoran I can't help but think that your last name has a typo. There's an 'a' where there should be an 'o'.

Yes, the virus started in China. That's where it was first discovered, and where patient zero was. It is a Chinese virus. That's not racism, that's what happened.
