@ron_donna My wife does, though she only raises the mask when near other people. I've been using gloves whenever I have to touch anything touched by others (shopping carts, doors, elevator buttons). I used a mask yesterday but it's really rinky-dink so doesn't seem very protective.

Very bad flu'
@mrdefender1983 @theyungswim @CNN @CillizzaCNN Aka it's fine when my people do it but when the other guys do it, it's "racist". The Chinese government tried blaming us for the virus, he's just reminding everyone where it really started before CNN and msnbc go on a "Trump started the coronavirus" tirade before the election

The four vectors of broad based and targeted measures, relief and stimulus to protect vital sectors, #SMEs, the livelihood of common folks and the #supplychains are crucial to sustaining the vibrant economy @realDonaldTrump has built up. #Chinesevirus would merely be a hiccup.
The new POTUS/Fed powers invoked, 

Natl Guard being mobilized, 

sudden $funding of citizens/businesses basic needs for a short time

...all in the name of a Chinese virus which, statistically, comes nowhere near the levels of danger that would justify our response.

@joshrogin Sometimes he lands himself on a roller caster which always takes U-turn after sometimes. Better stick to calling #Covid_19 #Wuhanvirus.
@coachmwatkins @jc3watkins I think that is where Wash St. got to in 2018/2019, but in 2017 they cruised inside on a slant even vs off coverage. They might throttle down, but the X/Z were definitely working inside.
