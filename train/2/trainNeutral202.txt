Like thousands of other businesses, my uncle's family-owned cidery has been forced to temporarily close because of the Chinese Virus. Heâ€™s still taking online orders & itâ€™s the best damn hard cider youâ€™ve ever tasted. Free enterprise is a beautiful thing.

@sonaliranade Lockdown here also to interrupt bthe spread of virus and also but time to boost the health infastructure.  In wuhan, it was 8 week. Not sure Pak and India can sustain for more then a month
@cocovirus90 @Zindagi_Is_Me @QIhangChen4 @sydnastayyyy @soumyamaina @Asifas90320 @ChicagoTraderrr How many times do I need to tell you that I'm not claiming to be smarter than the Chinese population or their government? I have yet to see anything that proves that the virus first occurred at a wet market or a dish involving a bat. If you have proof I'd be glad to see.
Buone notizie dalla #Cina: â€œthe average daily sales of key retail enterprises climbed 5.6% compared to mid-February. In early March, their average sales climbed 0.5% compared to the same period last month.

The story about @CNN's @andersoncooper refusing to inherit his Vanderbilt Family $50M 18,504-square-foot "townhouse" is hilarious.  Along with Coop's attempt to relate to the everyday common folk when he is reporting about economic hardship during Chinese Wuhan virus pandemic. https://t.co/fExA3NiLIl

@mariocarlos7 @ExtremelyGenius @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump He had enough energy and time to tweet hundreds of time a day about all kinds of bullshit and lies. But not one mentions the virus situation emerging in Wuhan. Such a stupid defense of someone who canâ€™t be defended
