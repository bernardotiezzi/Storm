@Centre_newz in ww2 we placed inflatable tank shaped balloons under light camouflage on our south coast to create a false impression ,WHY HAS CHINA ALREADY CLOSED THE NEWLY BUILT HIGHLY PUBLICIZED 16 WUHAN FLU HOSPITALS ? draw your own conclusions

Coolie is not about how you look, skin tone or what your hair type is.
“Coolie” is a derogatory term used toward East Indian immigrants in the Caribbean, v similar “Nigga” for black/African immigrants in America. The two are not interchangeable. They’re not casual words.
@Which_1ofYall Charlotte don’t have them?
There is a church very near my house. This time every Sunday, the streets are packed with cars of mass goers. It is kinda freaky that it looks like Zombieland here today. #COVID19
@Bill20206 @lesliea50665270 @MamaG111357 @joelockhart @PalmerReport Because the Piglosi and Scummer added in BILLION$$$$$ for public funded abortions in it.
They refuse to pass a “clean” Wuhan Virus Bill. Instead they fill it with BS and sheeple like you fall for the NO votes implying they (no’s) don’t care about solving the Wuhan Virus crisis.
Wuhan virus deaths adjusted for population https://t.co/1nniC8KFea
@AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump Great move genius🙄. He already restricted flights in January from the #KungFlu region and was labeled a racist. Stick to your hideous dance videos and keep the verbage out. You're welcome #dipshit

Martial law is the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions by a government, especially in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster, or in an occupied territory

#WuhanVirus isnt an invasion, major disaster or occupation
@SphaleriteMz @Pynch1999 @voxsusana @sentient72 @ProcReg @markpiesch @Google_Comms @MSNBC @CNN Trump or supporters never said it was a hoax, but the manipulation of democrats trying to stop travel bans and call Trump racist because of border security.  MSM called Wuhan virus for weeks, then once again its back to racism. The MSM narratives were the hoax.
@TheRealDonEast @DanGuy96 Remember when Ghostbusters 2016 was supposed to cost $50 million dollars and be a Spring flick for a quick buck

And then the reshoots happened and the marketing jack knifed into a girl power slant that was not prevalent in the film at all
@heatxdeath The slant nose Porsche is a modernization of a classic style. The headlights are in the bumper for better aerodynamics
@colintrevorrow when editing #JurassicWorldDominion, let the opening be reminiscent of the original film, with the same distant drum of music like a heavy dink footstep and that rising vocalisation as the titles come on screen. All over a black screen before fading into visuals.
There was a time when fadnavis government actively respond to any crises - whether giving holidays under severe rain or transporting water to the drought affected area. With ongoing 30 cases of Wuhan virus, that idiot uddhav hasn't done anything serious yet.
