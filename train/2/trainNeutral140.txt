@BirdieBagwell @lilakGGs @RaeofChange @pscottc @ChelseaClinton @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @CDCgov emergency until 4+ months later on October 25, 2009

Media did everything to calm & then memory hole his less than stellar job.

#Trump declared emergency about month after #CoronaVirus or #WuhanVirus, stopped Flights from China before before any deaths occurred or cases (con’t)
@HuXijin_GT @realDonaldTrump March9:circuit breaker
March12:circuit breaker
March16:circuit breaker
March16: At 18:51 pm after the market closed, Trump called “Chinese Virus” first time.
March17: Dow30 up and gained 1,048 points
March18:circuit breaker
So only one circuit breaker after Trump said that word.
@xdUjNXBvNiRAdWK @HyperZiraffe @Eliasistic @ejahania @alx @realDonaldTrump Aside from that... did you get the part about China and the Wuhan virus?!!  The schemes and plans? Heartbreaking!!
@piersmorgan Suspend all sport and public events for a month. Extend football season until June, Postpone Euro's till 2021. If China is anything to go by the virus will peak and then go down. But the Chinese ppl conform to the government, would we?

@30andAlone @KPlorable @Barumpabumbum @cliftneysterli1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @washingtonpost there are many coronaviruses, so it is terribly imprecise.  CoVid 19 or Wuhan virus are accurate.  Personally, I like WuFlu.
@Nicki95145891 @TimCamp71495351 @LIZinAUSTIN My great granddaughter would inherit them and wear them to the Inaugural Ball of Barron’s grandson, and everyone will talk about the “old days”, when the Wuhan Virus pandemic made people freak out about not having enough toilet paper 😂😂😂
