@ErinMcPike @BarackObama The complete lack of perspective on how the #TDS affected media "covers" @realDonaldTrump & the #ChineseVirus vs anything Obama ever did (or didnt do) is why you are getting ratioed. It's not anti-Obama. It's anti #FakeNews crowd that is sick of the narrative & bias
@JimMWeber 90%, only in jeopardy if the Wuhan virus remains a threat through the summer, unlike past influenza viruses.
