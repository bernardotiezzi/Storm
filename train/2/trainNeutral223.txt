@bigpapiiyogii @dink_berg I wish this was true ü§™
I want more power
@OdieFNBR Try not to push all the time, avoid dropping near your enemy or contest them if they're seriously damaged like just been in  a fight so they don't dink you later with 200 health and good loot. ALWAYS have heals (200 shield and like 3 minis) before you get in a fight
@atharvatambe1 @Orda_CS @AssauIt Bc aim assist was no longer balancing... controller players can now build/edit as fast and consistent as any KBM player but no KBM player can head dink like a controller player.. it‚Äôs the definition of unbalanced idk why this is a difficult concept

@ZhaLiyou Saying "final battle" like you're in a Hollywood movie doesn't really give the impression you think it's just a bad cold. Also, the virus is completely unaware of us. It doesn't feel fear like in cartoons.
@thfcrueben Fairs but midfield wise he‚Äôs the best at them dink balls over the defensive line.
I enjoy a good slant rhyme
@USUHNAME @roper_93 some are more nudged & edited for particular story slant  but not scripted.
Pros: naturalist Mary Oliver type language, kind of modern 
Cons: based mostly on slant rhymes and complicated meters I can‚Äôt read aloud quickly enough to hear, lots of invented past participles.
@CoachRmcD60 2x2. Backside slot runs a slant. Qb reads backside backer. He reads pulling guard and attacks, dump the slant;  he stays put, hand it off. Allows you to pick and hinge backside tackle to stop backside end from crashing on any kind of gap exchange
@hopeworldians @BTS_twt The article says BTS Jhope is the first person to be exclusively featured on the Penguin Village Mural. Jhope's Chinese fans originally planned to do it by themselves, but due to the corona virus situation, they couldn't make it and arranged the service. https://t.co/9FTIvs6nbm
@KarlreMarks @BronwynScottMc the only nice subway station in nyc is literally closed to the public - the abandoned city hall station
