@realDonaldTrump Why do you put words in all caps when unwarranted, and words in quotes (‚Äúborders‚Äù) - also unwarranted? Also, and importantly, it is NOT the Chinese Virus. You‚Äôre putting Asians in the U.S. in danger with this rhetoric. Repeat after me: COVID19.

@realDonaldTrump As usual he starts the fire, then comes in and tries to play the hero once it gets out of hand.  
Let's see how long he can go before referring it to the Chinese virus.

WHO Director cites deflated seasonal flu numbers- Confirmed seasonal flu rates are higher than estimates of #ChineseCoronaVirus

@juliaskih @dtc22 2 of 100?
As of Sunday
Of the over 254,000 Americans tested and received results,(the original CDC tests were faulty) slightly more than 30,000 testing positive
Or
Of those who thought they had the Chinese virus and got tested, ONLY 1 in 10 actually had it. 
9 in 10 did not
I do really feel like staying in the next one month in kololo

The case that mainstream coronavirus forecasts are too gloomy https://t.co/0hQaIAf57P The estimable Richard Epstein offers a contrarian view of the #WuhanVirus #coronavirus crisis. He argues that panic over the virus is significantly overblown.

@kpb1337 @Kyle_Beckley @KenCox @ananavarro @JoeBiden The economy-despite the temporary set back over the Wuhan virus world wide-is doing great. Theres been so many records broken on unemployment, etc that you seem to be unaware of. Our geopolitical landscape is looking good, there have been no meaningless wars-or do you want thst?
All grocery shops , vegetable fruit vendors chemists  should be open from morning to night so that there is no intermingling of crowds which will defeat the purpose of social distancing @narendramodi @PMOIndia @OfficeofUT @myogiadityanath @republic #ChinaVirus

@SheepSkate911 @Baligubadle1 @AdamParkhomenko International travel should have been shutdown in early December,  if following stockmarket chatter, we first heard of a Chinese health problem (virus) end of November.
