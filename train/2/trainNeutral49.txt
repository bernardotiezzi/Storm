@realDonaldTrump Coronavirus layoffs surge across America, overwhelming unemployment offices

Job-loss projections range up to 4.6 million.

How does Trump deal with this?

And golfing.

@iainpope73 @edinburghpaper @TheScotsman Headlines that slant the reader's interpretation of the article, especially when a neutrally worded article becomes taken as politically biased because of the headline.
Read his facial expression in yesterday's press conference. He paused looked down then out to the camera before saying "Chinese virus." He knew very well that he was twisting the truth to support his hateful agenda.
