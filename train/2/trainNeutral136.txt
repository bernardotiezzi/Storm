The US plans to force passengers to change routes, and potentially redirect entire flights, to make sure they get screened for the Wuhan virus https://t.co/4ntVRDzZ0H https://t.co/T2GBpU8ekw
A quick rule of thumb for nomenclature:

Coronavirus - a Family of positive sense single stranded RNA (Group IV) viruses

SARS CoV 2 - a member of the Coronavirus Family

COVID-19 - the current disease outbreak caused by SARS CoV 2

ChinaVirus - this person is a racist

Second wave hitting Singapore, mostly due to students and residents returning from abroad.
Closing borders is good but it cannot become the norm.

@JohnWoodrowCox @hannah_natanson @CNN @sbg1 @AlexWitt @MSNBC When the Left sees EVERY quote from Trump or the right as having a "racial slant" and harps on it over and over can anyone expect the kids to NOT pick up on the rhetoric whether they are racist or not.

@mattvillano @DrPaulGosar Is the term Spanish flu or Aussie flu racist? Only when these terms were used for strains of flu I didnâ€™t hear anyone objecting. Isnâ€™t it the case that people who complain about calling covid 19 Wuhan virus are the real racists because they see skin colour in everything?
@LynnetteBenni @HuneycuttDoug @rudolphshores @WomanWatching @JohnFromCranber @RepAdamSchiff Is it that hard to read? Ya know, when the sources you use for news calls it the same thing you shame trump for, or when you eat food that you call "chinese food" then get pissed when people call it "chinese virus" its pretty clear the hypocrisy you contain lmfao.
