@ferg_kevin @thehill The naming is in accordance with WHO nomenclature guideline of infectious disease revised in 2015. This is why people with common sense don't call it Wuhan virus.For covering up, it's easy to make a comment without knowing what it takes to identify and characterize a novel virus. https://t.co/61NHpC9F0r

@joelockhart @realDonaldTrump The Corona Foriegn Influenza 
Virus was first reported SARS 2005. Then MERS 2012 and now late 2019 Wuhan. Lucky 7.  

The National OBAMA CARE failed to stockpile and develop large ICU Quarantine Centers or made it a Hospital/Care facility requirement.

Self-checkout Counter Fail @Target; all users required use physically touch the unprotected screens without gloves on to finish checkout/pay. So you may not pass go but do collect the Wuhan virus.
One European official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, said there were multiple disagreements among the G-7 members Wednesday but acknowledged ‚ÄúWuhan virus‚Äù posed the most significant obstacle.

@DominicRaab @British_Airways Well done @British_Airways, but @DominicRaab why are we still getting flights in from all over the world??? A flight from #Beijing landed at #LondonHeathrow this morning. Where is the embargo on all #flights from #China? #ChinaLiedPeopleDied
@ValerioCapraro @mariawirth1 Is it possible that a combination of factors are at play? Temperature, humidity, direct contact with Wuhan, a more benign mutated version of virus in India, competing pathogens, better immunity etc.
