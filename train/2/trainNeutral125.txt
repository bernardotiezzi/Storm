For Valentine’s Day, I will be running a slot fade with a slant underneath. But this time, I will use a counter to fake the slot fade, hoping the DB bites on it over the top, leaving the slant wide open on the inside .

Between the slant on Rising since 08/19, appearing on the Sanders podcast, and appearances as an effective Sanders surrogate, it sure seems like Ball’s officially unofficially part of the campaign. https://t.co/vmA09gzR4X
@davidpaulk “Wuhan International Airport serves a population of 19 million people, but only 3,400 a day travel internationally ... New Chinese virus 'will have infected hundreds’ ” https://t.co/cyK3Nc9rZ6
@GregoryHardinII Disputes between Iraq & Kuwait’s exploitation of the Rumaila oil fields, which straddled the border between the two countries. Kuwait was accused of  “slant-drilling” to siphon off oil from the Iraqi side.

@corrigon_kc @MelissaResistss @MaggieJackson11 @Terri_Dink @DevinNunes @RoScarborough On March 28, 1933 there was a Decree for the Surrender of Military Weapons, which included bolt action military rifles and revolvers.A few days later Nazis raided homes in Jewish homes in Berlin. On April 4, 1933 search-and-seizure operations were executed.
So,we are heading into what may be a colder than normal winter with power and gas both too expensive for many elderly and Wuhan flu lurking. The government should address power costs as a matter of urgency. Now might be a good time to get bi partisan support for Nuclear power.
There's a certain Slant of light,

Shadows — hold their breath —

Depends rather on the number of base pair mutations that have presented since December 2019. There have been quite a significant number and it’s possible that the complete Wuhan positive sRNA virus genome is essentially differentiated from virus infections today

By certain ingredients i mean what makes up the “texture” of the scrub (sea salt, sugar, flower petals etc)
The finer/gentler/less chonky the material of the scrub, in most cases, the better. As always with anything, DO YOUR RESEARCH and I don’t mean look at the two first results
@sixonenineseven @Mina00910 @j2good4you @stardaniellee The fact that he looks middle Eastern or Arab low-key when he had that beard and his eyes slant in that weird way
