Welp, class is cancelled for 2 weeks ðŸ˜©
Passengers in all #China to US flights from Nov2019 to Jan2020 can provide better estimates; 5 million people left #Wuhan before its lockdown; Americans in Tech and industry returned; Chinese gov knew of Virus and locked down its military, then came to US for pandemic protocols https://t.co/GTEjC8ZUkR

@AudreyH79041604 Nice you are supporting this, my neighbor to my north.  I always loved Vancouver but it has changed.  I hope Wuhan Virus will be better contained than here but worry given the changes to that city since about â€˜97

How soon before they bring Vindmann in front of a camera to give his opinion of Trump's response to the Wuhan Flu

@williamcrawley @ianjamesparsley @McAuleyDeclan @London_Skylines @ArfurFawksAche @BBCTalkback The numbers required to cause herd immunity with measles is over 92%. Say corona virus is 60%. UK population 60m. Needs 36m to contract it. Rate in Italy of 6.6% fatalities. 2.3m deaths at that hit rate. If herd immunity is such a fab idea why did the chinese not adopt it?
School closings 
Sports seasons canceled
Travel restrictions 
Our local Cherry Blossom Festival- our biggest event of the year in Macon, GA- is canceled.
Everything that can be done to protect against the WUHAN VIRUS is being done.

The dumb@ MEDIAVIRUS is still a problem...
@mirror0002 @zlj517 @EsperDoD @DeptofDefense @Surgeon_General @PatDonahoeArmy @ianbremmer @broadcastmike The Chinese Communist Party revises history at home, reverses the truth, shirks the source of the virus to the US military, and uses nationalism to mobilize the Chinese people against the United States
 To cover up the true blame for the CCP â€™s decision delay

On a flight back from CDG to MSP now. Flight attendant said that all International flights into MSP are canceled (after this one? Today?), as MSP does not have the appropriate CDC status/staffing. Broader announcement coming later I guess? #rumor #MSPairport #WuhanVirus #covid19
#NSTworld: In the month since the #virus #outbreak began late in December, #cooking and food-related content drew more than 580 million views on its platform, Chinese video streaming firm Billibilli said.

Iâ€™m now worried about both my ability to fly to America in May as well as the viability of the Indy 500 actually happening. Fuck me. Fuck China too. Fuckers couldâ€™ve contained this shit easily.

#BVSD kids are in school in the worst weather conditions, ice, blizzards, floods, and lockdowns.  However, #WuhanFlu #WuhanCoronavirus is the first thing I've ever seen close the school district like this...
