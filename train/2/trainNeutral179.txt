It's a shame that so few will be able to see NEVER RARELY SOMETIMES ALWAYS given the current state of the world because it's exactly the kind of empathetic, humanistic story we could use now. I spoke to writer/director Eliza Hittman for @Slant_Magazine: https://t.co/MkY1OtjFhr
@GrrrGraphics Gates. Eugenics. Foundation. Microsoft HQ. Washington. Gatesâ€™ interview re virus pandemic soon. WHO. Most Wuhan virus deaths in USA in Washington. Elderly. Coincidence?
@SenatorFischer @SenatorSinema @SenateDems As usual, this only half of the story. Please describe all the other non Wuhan Virus related items in the bill.

I'll wait
@xX_MrMurphy_Xx @emotionalhugz @JamesIaniro It's fake. The publishing house added this in the book and changed the name of the original russian virus to make it chinese and get quick sales. If you have an old copy you can tell easily.
@SamuelJComroe Possibly. Cancellations and postponements could be extended. ðŸ˜•
Yet San Francisco has scheduled conventions, invited tourists, held sporting events with mass crowds breathing this deadly unhealthy fecal matter daily.

media owned by 6 people intentionally hype this virus to destroy economy, china released wuhan virus targeted at elderly
I heard DVD / Blu-ray copies of Contagion (2011) are selling for $1000 on EBay.
Rumor has it if you watch it backwards it vaccinates you against the #WuhanVirus
@thattugglife
Be warned, Disney is shutting down the parks at the end if the business day on the 15th until the end of the month. Resorts will be open. Wuhan Virus stupidity. Check your plans & reschedule as you see fit. Many vaca insurance plans don't cover thÄ±s sort of closure.

#Sensex stands for Sensitive Index. Coming week, major crowded places like Stadiums, parks, cinema house, hotels likely to be closed for public as a #WuhanVirus caution. Then follows the media panic.

Recovery in such scenario seems impossible. There is no such thing as Bottom.
@JoannieTheJedi Heâ€™s so damn dramatic
Some lady at Rite Aid aggressively steps (nearly jumps) away from me when ever I walk forward in line at the pharmacy. 

Bitch you got the wrong chink! Iâ€™m Vietnamese yo!!!!!
@DonnieGoAway @TeamPelosi @RashidaTlaib @SpeakerPelosi @WSJ As if paid sick leave #PelosiPandemic legislation has anything to do with #WuhanVirus how do abortions cure it? You canâ€™t clean ðŸ’©off your sidewalks how you gonna cure #WuhanVirus

@realtexpatriot @ChrisLoesch @mycuzzinvinni @nprfreshair @ddiamond The Covington catholic kids?  The NY Times and cnn retracting headlines and stories they were wrong about?  Saying restricting flights from China was wrong and racist?  The media called it the wuhan virus from the beginning and all of a sudden now itâ€™s racist?  Jussie Smollett?
