@Coach_Sneed_ Done it before locking head up to outside with both tackles, sliding the inside 3, with the rule that nothing could work across the guards face on the backend of the slide. Play side, if the end were to slant across the tackle’s face, he wouldn’t chase, but wait for what becomes.
HOLLOW @RhondaParrish Young Adult tale of gritty teenage angst with paranormal slant. @TycheBooks @NetGalley My review: https://t.co/HQDNxaB5FI
@RBI announcement regarding MP of 3 months on all loans including deferment of interest servicing in working capital facilities is a welcome step towards strengthening the economy which was affected due to #ChineseVirus @narendramodi clealry bold step towards #sabkasathsabkavikas

Going to town tomorrow (((((-:
Another example: this time Hurts wants the ISO slant on third and short. Edge drops from on the line into the passing lane, isn't there. Check the inside slot on the other side, stacking and winning for a TD. Hurts is too late off the slant to get to the opposite seam. https://t.co/Pp3rW53Rqj
@AbhishBanerj @naukarshah @Coldplay91 @narendramodi None of the hospitals have seen a large influx of patients with high fever.
This has been happening in countries like Italy, France, UK, Germany, USA etc.

Where have all the patients gone @naukarshah ?

In India, community spread hasn't started for #ChineseVirus

@kramerreport Contrast w/ Oct, 2018-May, 2019 flu season in Missouri:
92 deaths from flu itself
1,721 death from flu related pneumonia

The MSMs' #ChineseVirus hysteria is manufactured to hurt @POTUS's reelection chances as much as possible.

@mark_melbin @mjrowland68 @GideonCRozner @abc730 @ABCmediawatch @latingle But tax layers are now laid off, so there's less money to pay for the ABC. So what is the ABC Executive proposing to its Board & the Minister to achieve comparable efficiencies to avaliable funding. If the ABC is part of Australia then surely they take the Chinese Virus hit too.
@LindaEpai457450 @KAG_Patriots @ScottGottliebMD @RaheemKassam American businesses also had people (re: Americans) flying in and out of China, and even Wuhan. You can't blame it on only Chinese people traveling. It's a global economy and Americans, as well as people from many other countries, were in China and helped spread the virus.

Hamler is the 2nd fastest WR in the draft (behind Ruggs) and he outruns the entire Ohio St defense here. He runs a nice slant against future 1st round CB Shaun Wade. Taking a step outside then exploding inside. Once he catches it he's off to the races and no one can keep up. https://t.co/nJ2XSdcESK

Wiithout federal parliament sitting we are being  governed by federal  LNP govt. ministers in consultatiion with state  govts. This is exactly the way the Chinese govt. works. Let us hope it stops the virus as well as China did.
@Ocelotkharn @mbeenox @BStapleG @Wheldon91 @Delep00jung @ryanstruyk @CNN @JohnsHopkins You mean like when they arrested doctors or forced them into silence for telling international news outlets about the virus in December and January? You mean all the Chinese citizens who attempted to video blog their illness and them disappearing from Twitter? Want sources?

@charliekirk11 Epicenter is a word used in describing seismic activity, not a medical pandemic.
The absolute apex of the CCP corona virus will always, and historically be, Wuhan China.
