@mp_renee @theredshift11 @ProletariatRis1 @thomassherm @willbkendall @RobNOLA1959 @BernForBernie20 @JoeBiden The virus came from China but not all Chinese descent/Asian-looking people have the virus already. Asian-looking people around the world are being attacked even if they have the virus or not.
@Roxannethedog @R_Z_army @seanhannity Then what do you call a ‚Äúgathering‚Äù at the White House (daily) with the President, VP, Head of the CDC, Head of the NIH at the podium? Information, updates and developments concerning the Wuhan flu are relayed at said ‚Äúgathering‚Äù...I would call that a briefing worthy of airing.

@runbaja20 @notthesameone2 @RyanKJames @TheFredGood @Crisis_x2 @LowStakesDaniel @alx @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @washingtonpost Because there are fuckheads who should know better working in the media, just like there are fuckheads working in any industry?

Locals, your timestamp will be double-checked with the intl forms due to the fcfs basis but will still be on the waitlist for batch 2 if you did not get in. If you opt for collection at a convention, you'll only be able to get in May.
