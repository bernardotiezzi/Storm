Ruggs: Takes simple, short plays, and gets more yards. Underrated with his yards after contact. Slant routes can become explosive plays. Smaller, but fast

@DustyRoseYYC Dead people reduce Canada's CO2 emissions and it kills mostly the elderly thereby reducing the drain on health care and pensions. Wuhan flu is a net positive for the country.

So no, the focus on the next budget will be climate change.

@RealtorSullivan @CBSNews "Chinese" can also be used as an adjective to describe another word, such as "Chinese" food. Don't take it so seriously. Have you ever heard the term "American" food, or "Italian" food? This virus came from China, and therefore Chinese Virus is an accurate term.

@IanECox The prospect of losing a minimum of 2 people in 10 in my immediate family vis a vis diplomatic rectitude is an insane proposition.

The virus would have probably gotten here but to facilitate it so flippantly? If it is not the Chinese then public officials will get lynched.
