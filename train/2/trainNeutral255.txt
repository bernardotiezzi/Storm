@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Biden can't remember what he said two seconds after he speaks so how in the hell would he help in anyway his speech would be re-elect Trump and everyone that is there would just laugh their ass off plus the stock market will be higher than ever when the Chinese virus is gone!
