Opens up high hole instead of running it off to open low hole if f3 player bites https://t.co/n6aaUCGxL3
@TheBeardedRauI I love the way he winds up to strike sees the run and then dinks it in behind all whilst the ball‚Äôs in the air

@robert_spalding Perhaps a combination of factors ‚Äî lines canceled due to the face recognition law, the new ability to port numbers, lines canceled due to non-payment (locked up and not able to work), and from death. 

But these numbers point to huge numbers of #CCPVirus fatalities ‚Äî 1 million+.
He ain‚Äôt the only one that choked. 1st pass was slightly over thrown. Pass 5&7 where both slightly too low and the 6th pass we gon be mad at Hurst for trying to finish his slant and go route ü§® I Love Lamar but he was trying to do to much running the ball.. Lamar on top soon tho https://t.co/cvV9K5kFPy
