He's a system DB. He has benefited from a strong pass rush his whole career.  He plays cover 3 coverage every time. He never turns his hips all he does is sit on the out, the slant and square in.  He won't be a 1st ballot HOFer. Come back to this tweet when he's up for the hall https://t.co/I3EI7SthuV

Myth: Cold weather itself causes cold/flu.

Fact: Cold/Flu is more common in winter because ppl get in close proximity in winters in closed spaces, e.g rooms with less ventilation. This causes the droplets to remain in a room longer and thus more infections. https://t.co/hWVx1INHn7
