@king_kazontae I routed you on the fake face & then back to the slant had u almost falling
Which is the problem 

The Numerator ( low number of doctors) 

Or 

The Denominator ( high population  ) 

Ps - India has one of the best public health system in the world 

Pps - Protocols for #WuhanVirus exist 

Protocols for stupidity doesn't https://t.co/bExMWh2njE
#coronavirus #facemasks Wearing facemask is the same as washing hands to prevent the virus from entering the mucous membrane of your mouth and nose. Covid-19 can be spread by spitting in face-to-face talking, that's why Chinese doctors advise people to wear facemask. It works.
The Indian corporates and billionaires have to come out to support the govt in these difficult times to fight against COVID19.None of the corporates came forward so far when the govt is fighting tooth and nail against the ChineseVirus.
@SilencSsola @klO8sxhUMCCe3Ex So, in the six months, in the situation that the airport and train station have not been closed, and no cross-border travel has been affected, has no other country been infected? Or has all countries regarded the highly contagious #ChineseVirus as flu for half a year?
I always knew spring was about here when I would see the shortened version of this commercial and the SunSetter Awning commercials. Guess we won't be seeing it this year with the Wuhan Virus running around the world. https://t.co/oRVDVRyE0H

@jordanmoore I was re-reading our weekend thread‚Ä¶ how do you feel about saying "emergent vs. intentional" vs. "emergent vs. idealized?"

Idealized has a more sarcastic slant to the tone of it‚Ä¶ but it speaks a little louder for me.

With 9 career INTs, ball production is a big plus or White. Really showed up as a senior though, with 11 PBUs and 3 INTs in that hybrid role. Does a good job here of reading the QB and undercutting the slant for the INT vs Vandy this past season https://t.co/YcX41maKgw
