@ZaneZ_world @terry_burch @CNN @StCollinson The virus has a long incubation period and the symptoms are very similar to the flu.  The Chinese government and medical institutions also took a long time to figure out the exact information about the virus.  what precautions have US taken after you heard about the virus?
Still govt. bureaucrats are standing in the way with their regulations/#TDS/ and power trips. #DrainTheSwamp #Tucker #CoronaVirusUpdate #ChineseWuhanVirus #ChinaVirus #Hannity #IngrahamAngle #KAG2020LandslideVictory

When I worked in the Clean Room, we had adhesive floor mats that we walked on when we went into the lab to prevent spreading bacteria & viruses to the "Clean" area. My advice, don't wear shoes indoors because the virus survives on surfaces for a couple of days. #WuhanVirus

@realDonaldTrump beach goers that are canceling trips are being asked to still pay most of the rental fee. This is robbery to people trying to do the right thing.Please ask/demand that resorts and private renters not force payment for canceling due to the Chinese Virus spread.
@inKelso @SenateGOP So laughable. I can envision this person in a helmet so they don't hurt themselves when they go to McDonald's. You know the type "I love all people", until they see a black man in their yard, "Quick call the cops, he's gonna Rob us"  then call you racist for saying Wuhan Virus...

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is offering financial incentives to businesses who create masks, gloves, and suits for the ChinaVirus pandemic. 

Thank you Governor for your help. All parties and countries must unite together to defeat COVID19.
@c_aashish Kerala govt will clear arrears by April 2020 that alone amount to Rs. 14,000 crore (hardly benefiting 1.5 % of Kerala populous). So, 90 % of the package will not be released by April and by that time this Chinese virus will vanish from Indian soil while leftist media will do PR.

@NathanDahm @SrsAltAcct @GregoryHardinII @squintessential @MDCarrier @ErinWilliford1 @AshHeddy @angpjfl For starters, at no point have I ever mentioned anything or anyone being racist. My point is accuracy, and avoiding potential unforeseen repercussions of the ongoing needless usage of identifying a pandemic virus as ‚ÄúChinese.‚Äù

I wanted to write an essay for the Globe and Mail's opinion page but quite hesitate to do so because I know it will surly make my life troublesome. The intended title is "The corona virus, China, Chinese, Chinese Canadian, and their overlap with CCP". You can use it for writing.
