1000s of runners the city used to see specially between December and January in this strech and over 50K on the day of Mumbai marathon. Sad to see such a desserted site.

It's a difficult fight for everyone but let it continue until we fight the #WuhanVirus. #CoronavirusIndia https://t.co/y5C6sZMuan https://t.co/GWjjf82KOe

We‚Äôll never know which bcuz they kept it secret 4 MONTHS, & R still LYING about it now!
