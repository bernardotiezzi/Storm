Understanding the stand off between the Roman and Persian Empires involves understanding all three in conjunction for example...
@BiasedGirl Part II, Part III, Jason X & Freddy vs. Jason are the good ones for everyone staying in tonight because of the Chinese Kung Flu Foreign Wuhan Virus.
Polish border closed for ALL foreign nationals, excluding residents. Shopping centers closed, restaurants and pubs closed or serve takeout only. All international flights and trains CANCELLED. Schools closed. Feeling safe with my supplies. We in quarantine #COVID19 #WuhanVirus
@mcspocky @WeavieTheGoat With the all sporting events canceled and states declaring state of emergencies due to the Wuhan virus. I guess all the States that still need to vote for the Democratic nominee should be postponed too? I think we should cancel the voting until everything is ok.

I appreciate people use humour to deflect from worry, but I'd suggest that when the far-right are deliberately trying to get #Covid_19 renamed "Wuhan Virus" and people are being beaten up in racist attacks because of it, it's probably not the time for making crass racist jokes. https://t.co/dmVWKPPrVJ
