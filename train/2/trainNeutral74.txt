I am sure drumpf is already planning his "Huge Really Great Massive Easter Day Military Victory Parade again the Chinese Virus" where he will award himself a Medal of Honor and nominate himself for a Nobel Peace Prize.
@howells_dai @piersmorgan Family members had persistent cough and high temp over Christmas until the end of January. We live 500m from Bicester Village which is a prime destination for Chinese tourists shopping.  We have a Tesco next door frequented by same tourists. Iâ€™m sure this virus was here.

Downes presses high, balls breaks for Keane, he works himself half a yard of room down the right and dinks the ball back for Sears to force home from edge of the six yard box. 1-1 (55)

Interested in how D coaches coach box/2-man in short redzone area. IMO, bracketing slant w/ 2nd inside defender or $ doesn't provide significant benefit vs stack/bunch (have end line to help deep and already have inside leverage). Biggest threat is defined leverage vs release
