Keep your eye on Wuhan virus in Singapore. 

Average temps in Singapore range from 80 to 91 degrees with high humidity.  Virus is still not spreading rapidly there. Why is that? Media not covering it. https://t.co/qKRzB3KH5v
French President addressed the French public
British PM addressed British populace. 
UAE, USA, Canada, Ghana & countries  led by serious minded leaders addressed their people as regards Chinese virus but one Adamu in Aso Rock is still busy learning how to pronounce corona virus

@netanayhu @PaleoPhil credible sources are linked and credited in graphs and maps, usually at the bottom of the graphic.
@Q4ALL3 @lmramey The Jussie Smollett Audacious Mendacity Award for 2020 may already have been won by the MSM #Presstitutes for their COVID-19 (i.e. WUHAN VIRUS) panic reportage! A Presidential Award might want to have the names McGovern and Mondale in it!  M&Ms?

@Actualsize @chiproytx @TomFitton @tedcruz @SenMikeLee @SenTomCotton @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump I remember the Left and their leadership call Trump xenophobic for restricting travel from China. 
The response team was formed for the Ebola endemic. It‚Äôs mission was accomplished, the team disbanded, and the lead reassigned ...well  before there was a a Wuhan virus issue.

@LubingT Considering I likely have more of a chance of getting struck by lightening than being hospitalized due to the Chinese virus, I‚Äôm not worried

@lukedepulford Er. Actually I try very hard to persuade my parents to wear masks probably, wash hands more frequently. üò£coz they are more easier inflected n have more serious consequences #WuhanVirus
@eugenegu I lived in Italy. In the last one month, when I walked on the street, people coughed at one, covered their mouths when they see me, some people even shouted "Chinese virus" in Italian. It leads to more discrimination. If you name Elbola "Black Virus", what will others say?
@SiddiquiMaha Sometimes real life can be as gripping and strange as fiction. In Robin Cook novels there is always a villian. Here it has to be the CHinese wet markets where Virus crossovers to humans happens.

Who is going to ban them?

@Mawufeasi @palacios289 @_ReaalAmerican_ @jabinbotsford @realDonaldTrump there is an ENORMOUS difference between "a new SARS virus strain originating from china" and "THE CHINESE VIRUS". the first is purely fact and the latter is intentionally inflammatory language
