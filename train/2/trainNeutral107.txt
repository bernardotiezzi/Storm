@Natalia01Mateo Wow, what's with the bars on the Windows?  It makes me wonder if there is something about this particular virus that the Chinese know that the rest of us don't.  Their biological warfare lab is located in Wuhan, could this virus have been manipulated into a Frankenstein monster?

All tube & underground services in every country need to run a skeleton service, so only essential travel can happen.

Sometimes they have a similar feature, but often as minimal as just like the eyes and the way the crease or slant, or just the mouth shape, but nothing else. And I really think people be blind. It's almost the same experience as when you can tell people can't or don't pick up
