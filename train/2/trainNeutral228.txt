@TitletownReign @OurLiquidDuck He played dink/dunk all 1st half, “in the system” and taking what the defense gave him (and what the OLine didn’t).  Everyone’s mad because the D controlled the game and our D didn’t bother. He plays #RodgersBall, going deep/spreading it out and they’re mad it wasn’t sooner 🤷‍♂️
rodgers : slant-flat :: wilson : stick
Chances for either side.
🔸 Kelly with Ayr’s best chance of the match as breaks forward but he bends his shot round Watson and wide
🔸Shanks then dinks a cross to McMullan but the winger is deemed to foul Harvie when winning the header

All #arashi PVs or concert vids have a slightly different slant after seeing how much work #matsujun does behind the screens.

@SBundell @Proud_Lightwood Cloak goes under the backpack, between the loops, for that “Cape” look.

Unless it’s a big chonky John Snow one, or its raining, in which case it goes over the backpack too.
@projectjax Thomas catches a seven yard Slant like nobody else before him..... 😂😂
@Dink_Dara @buckywilscn Evans scares me sometimes-

@RyanDGraham @Holls4Holly @JennaLaineESPN @Buccaneers Yards after catch.  Catch a slant or get open in middle of a zone defense and let your stud WRs make the play.  Don’t rely on the qb throwing into double coverage 15-20 yds down field where defenses are baiting him
