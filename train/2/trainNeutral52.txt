@POTUS did extremely well with bringing back manufacturing jobs and strictly enforcing immigration laws. US economy is chugging along despite Wuhan virus misinformation by #FakeNews and deranged democrats. #Trump2020 #KAG https://t.co/MMNnGQjCH3

In these trying times we need more romance - and if it happens to have an Irish slant, well so much the better! For a light read, a bit of suspense, some steam and a few curses, try these - on Amazon in both kindle and paperback. And only 16 days till book 3 comes out... https://t.co/uAwSmnzC2j

Jimmy G struggles progressing through reads so badly. Kittle literally runs wide open up the seam and he forces his first read to a slant to a covered receiver short of the first down.
piers morgan constantly calls out the left (particularly) for being offended by everything

While the impact ofÂ fluÂ varies, CDC estimates thatÂ influenzaÂ has resulted in between 12,000-61,000 deaths annually since 2010 in the USA!  Here we are doing stupid shit over the Wuhan Virus. Open everything back up and bring back sports. This is crazy

@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @FitnessGov @IvankaTrump @MarianoRivera @HerschelWalker @JohnnyDamon @DrOz When are the big white ships with red crosses coming. It's the American Virus now or Novel Corona Virus or COVID-19 not the Chinese Virus. Markets tanking bigly. When can those who are already laid off get HELP? Where are all the millions of test kits?
