@saraborhaz I would tie in historical context - 
SO when I would cover @chenchenwrites' "Self Portrait With & Without", I covered articles about the foundations of Chinatowns across the US; the details about the Chinese exclusion act; if I were teaching now, I'd add #45's "Chinese Virus" BS.

@Chopstyx13 @ThatIsokoGuy @Involution88 @dreadmarine @wecas_ @XHNews Nationalising it affects people's reaction and behaviour.Look at these 2 scenarios.Imagine explaining to an illiterate what #COVID19 is without labeling it a "Chinese virus" and explaining to another illiterate but labeling it a "Chinese virus".How do u think they'll both react??
