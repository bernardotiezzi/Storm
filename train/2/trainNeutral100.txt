@ChuckCallesto The homeless don't normally file tax returns they do get donations who are now low on money to give thus they need a check too to continue living. You want to shut down the country for Chinese virus/martial law you should take care of every American, born or naturalized.

@catohagen @AbuzzDesigns @joeltelling @erikcederb @3DVerkstan @WHO Is part of having a nickname putting "this" in front of it? Like do you refer to your daughter as "this Maddie?" Typically when you have to put "this" if front of something like you did in an earlier tweet about "this Chinese virus" you're trying to call attention to it.

@ezy06001 @julie_kelly2 @adamgoldmanNYT "Years old leaks" Never does the times miss a chance to show their slant
Like if we can choose our words based on connotations (for example, "cheap" and "frugal" are synonyms but carry very different meanings), then it shouldn't be that hard to choose to say "CORONAVIRUS" or "COVID-19" instead of "ThE ChiNeSe vIRuS".
