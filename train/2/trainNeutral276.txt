"Disappear" is such an ugly transitive verb. https://t.co/z4vX5D6uhu

@Z_Daskalov13 @hstempin92 @barstoolsports Tight end against zone. Slant/RB flat against man/blitz. Or if you’re a Ravens fan like me, Lamar can gain an easy 20 around the left side against man

@thecoachvogt Bubble Slant allows for quick and decisive read....no sacks, no picks
Hard disagree. Easy to cover when you have an expert “user picker” playing safety. Best play is two backs in the shotgun, switch formation so it’s 2 fast backs - run half back angle for the inside curl, re-route other back to an out. Re route slot receiver to slant - OPTIONS BABY https://t.co/3kQCf5VMMk

@tanner__page @barstoolsports Love this play. So easy to just read the left side of the field and hit the slant or the RB flat route. I barely even look right side of the field.

@kevinfolta @UF_IFAS @OneHealthUF @ilariacapua Was this recorded before or after the current firestorm broke out on Chinese social media surrounding the death of Dr. Li Wenliang? At 47:00 my mind went to the letter he got from the local police trying to shut down his early observations of the virus.
