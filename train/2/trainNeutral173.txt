In line at the supermarket and out of nowhere, a little boy no older than 10 walks up to me, Pulls my arm and whispers in a scared voice. 
Hi Mister ,Why would Nancy Pelosi work with China to releases the Wuhan virus to hurt America ? 
I left my cart and ran away.
At the Airport, waiting for my flight. Wow! This is like the Day before Christmas. There are so many people. 
Sad to realize the Pelosi's of this world want to politicize the Wuhan virus to stop Trump from getting re-elected :-(

New home Construction, New Home Sales, and Existing Home Sales were on the books before the Media Meltdown was ratcheted up to 11. #RealEstate
Confession #12: I'm running out of confessions because my life is already open a|f.
@cvpayne @AJLOVESPETS Charles, I just want to see churches open again.  There are people who rely on the open doors of their church to carry them emotionally through all sorts of things worse than Wuhan virus.  I'm praying for sensibility to prevail.

Looking at the Christmas time like shopping lines and sold out, empty shelves. Will this spending give boost to the economy? #WuhanVirus #covid19 #coronapocalypse
@WWG_1WGA_ Ultra-rich elites seizing opportunity to take profits in highest market EVER under cloak of anonimty provided by #WuhanVirus. They AVOID DIRECT BLAME for tanking the economy which they ARE doing on purpose, trying to negatively affect Trump's re-election since impeachment failed.
@garyhay2 @hog_whisperer Where is the coverage of the seasonal flu, or how about Veteran suicide? The media outlets and others who are inciting wuhan virus panic among people are doing so with intentions of their own self interest caused be sever #TDS .
Vail Resorts shutting down due to #KungFlu. It doesn't matter to me. I don't visit the High Country in the winter

@SteveScalise @JerryCo81356510 @realDonaldTrump When everything including the kitchen sink is used to tarnish his reputation & fails, 0 is held back. Russia-gate, Impeachment-gate, and now, Corona-gate. That same media said "Wuhan virus" for weeks, then point at Trump for "foreign". Crazy people are mad at Trump for this.
I've used up all of my fake smiles a long time ago.
@FOX13News Spring break is next week.  Theyâ€™re only closing for 1 week because of the #KungFlu
@Gammonesque1 @GiftCee @SteveUnwin01 @piersmorgan Large aging population
Italians have been using huge numbers of chinese immigrants to do manual jobs over last decade
Chinese own and staff many businesses there
Its not hard to find links to complete the chain if you want to understand the huge impact this virus is having there.
@BarneyGimble @XHNews It is not a "tabloid" "The New York Post, established on November 16, 1801, as the New-York Evening Post, describes itself as the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper. "
Of course, a Chinese troll wouldn't know that ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

Mall closure would hurt retail spending. In India it's last quarter of fiscal year. So this is likely to drag down entire years earning....

@DrNealHouston @realDonaldTrump @GOP Not just Federal Government, but most necessary portions of the private sector.  Google seems to be doing its usual underhanded game. Trump would have announced their upcoming website to screen for COVID19-19/Wuhan Virus, unless they had promised more.
Resistance for public PR.
