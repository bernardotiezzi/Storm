There’s a certain slant of light, 
On winter afternoons, 
That oppresses, like the weight 
Of cathedral tunes.

#LunarNewYear started on Jan 25, it should have been declared an emergency by Jan 10. Tens of thousands of people have been in contact with the virus, over 600,000 #Chinese have gone to #hongkong. Too late. @nytimes @WSJ @FinancialTimes @cnni https://t.co/q8FvzQp2Un
@FBDevCoach I've also got a sight adjustment to a slant by the left slot WR too if the LB to his side comes out to redirect, he'll go slant if he's flat, or drag if he gets depth.  Either way, I should win there or to the 1st read out route on the right slot.

@KeithNedrelo @avuhhhh12 @intricate119 Here's my tin foil hat in action: Up until Saturday there were videos being leaked from Chinese hospitals showing dead bodies in hallways and videos of doctors and nurses saying the government has lied about the extent of the virus. There have been no leaked videos since then.

There's a certain Slant of light, 
Winter Afternoons-- 
That oppresses, like the Heft 
Of Cathedral Tunes-- 

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us-- 
We can find no scar, 
But internal difference, 
Where the Meanings, are--… https://t.co/4LvMjNCVUE
