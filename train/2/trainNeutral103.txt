Javon Hargrave is a damn good player. Position flexibility, good pass rusher, consistently productive. Thick lower half, smooth feet, can stunt, twist and slant from a variety of positions.
@MikeWoodsII Did it help on the slant passes
@buzzcutsngravy when you're in trips, it takes advantage of the weak hook (who pushes to the strong hook technically) player opening up to the strongside to match the #3 receiver. basically he turns his head and melt away from a backside dig/skinny post/seam/slant, etc opening up natural window
@PBoogieYGB Go route, Post, Slant, Curl, Out, Fade, Punt Return, Kick Return. NFL or XFL in 3 years
@MSNBC If Sanders wins or comes in a close 2nd are you going to support the frontrunner or continue to slant the other yelling old man and the inexperienced, unliked in his own city, kid mayor? https://t.co/lRXFfXZe1R
@txhsfbchat Like power read reading the 4i, usually helps quarterback read knowing he has a pulling guard coming if he pulls. A lot depends on that play side overhang backer, have also read him. With any success opens RPO slant with single WR side. Make em wrong! #TXHSFBCHAT https://t.co/bbALwhbPQY
@realDonaldTrump  American Business insurance does not cover business loss due to flu or virus, unless it was caused by Bioterrorism.  @GOP @DeptofDefense @ICEgov @CFR_org  @SenateGOP  @FoxNews . This could be leaked from Chinese Bio weapons unit.  @CFR_org  @BBCClick https://t.co/OVhEZGlg25
@TDaily2020 @drboymom @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump The spanish flu has always been called the spanish flu, the corona virus has always been called the corona virus or covid-19 not the chinese virus so stop sucking trumps dick and trying to say hes basically the best president ever
@BlindWaveProd #legendsQnA what's it like to essentially be cannon in the #arrowverse ?
@favid_dink Months just make it more exciting though like saying "it's December tomorrow" is so much more exciting than saying "it's day 335 tomorrow"
Mat North, Hwange District in Zim is a Corona Virus red flag. Its the Victoria Falls tourists influx plus the high number of Chinese imigrant workers undertaking ongoing projects thats putting this district at the centre. Rumours of new arrivals among ē Chinese isn't helping ! https://t.co/vnbfbRwhOV
@penelopesire @Pappiness @realDonaldTrump Corona means Crown, which is what the virus looks like under a microscope, it doesn’t look like China. That’s a fact. It already had a name. Rebranding it a Chinese virus is an attempt to shift blame for its spread in America.

@PaulRieckhoff Traditionally, reporters report what is happening without opinion, and the editorial board gives its opinion. Newspapers have always had a partisan slant, and readers knew what it was. Now, people will accuse reporters of bias.
The author can't help putting a subtle slant on the article...https://t.co/uVmtmwfzep
