@marklevinshow Her bill includes 1. Green house gases regulations on the airlines.  2. Credits for wind and solar .  Pelosi is playing politics to get dems green new deal baloney in the Chinese virus bill.
Love the subtle RPO change up from LSU. Most of the time the RPO is on the same side as the back so the QB can read it easily. Here the RPO is opposite the back. Q reads the weak safety. He spins down...throw the slant or glance in behind him. https://t.co/kGuWxPH9Go
@ACPocketNews Makes me wonder if the grass is hardier too, like if it'll be destroyed if I run too much or not

This has led to speculation that the 1918 flu pandemic originated from China. The relatively mild flu season and lower rates of flu mortality in China in 1918 may be explained due to the fact that the Chinese population had already possessed acquired immunity to the flu virus.
The Purdue corners had a lot of trouble with Reagor's speed. Corner doesn't even try to stay square on him. Opens hips almost immediately to the sideline in fear of a go ball. Reagor sees the hips flip outside and smoothly goes underneath to the slant. Nice. https://t.co/rZ2ilCLACG

@Lexielhasaapso @Brett_Bends @EdwardTHardy @realDonaldTrump Angiosperms are plants that flower, but rarely does anyone plant angiosperms. They are flowers.

Italy then allowed 100,000 Chinese from Wuhan/Wenzhou to move to Italy to work in these factories, with direct Wuhan flights. Result:  Italy is hotspot 4 Wuhan Virus https://t.co/5PqE8wbaPI
