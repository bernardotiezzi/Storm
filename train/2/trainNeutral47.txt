We used to sit in front of our lockers with our heads between our knees conducting drills in preparation for the Soviets turning us all into charcoal briquettes.

Attackers are buff and TALL. They're speedy and able ro dish out multiple hits at a time, usually with quick succession. They're not as chonky as the others in their species, but they're buffer than normal. They have four arms with some spider-like limbs on their back,
