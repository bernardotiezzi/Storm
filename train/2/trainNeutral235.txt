@CoachMac8740 @domehats @playfastfb Go 2x2, Smash concept w/ #2 WR having an option to adjust 7 rout based on the leverage of their defender. #1 WR will change their outside rout to a slant or shallow dig. W/ pressure, QB can throw quick to back corner of the EZ, hit seam if #2 goes vert or #1 if he can win inside.
@CoachMac8740 @domehats @playfastfb Jumbo strong to wide side. HB fakes the Dive...Strong side TE curl, backside TE slant backside WR slant, play side WR Quick out

@app_s_ru It has 2 new level packs/bosses, 
An isometric one with a completely different slant on gameplay mechanics. A retro one which featured WAY back in the god old flash days. Some new music, new cutscenes and promos, revamped menus and tutorials, fixed softlocks, controller rumble...
