@Peston Robert, way do you think Europe & US don‚Äôt temporarily close financial markets for a ‚Äòbank holiday‚Äô, in the way Chinese did, in order to stem panic & hysteria during the most intense period of virus containment ?

@D_Blanchflower @charliebilello Plunge in copper started in early January; maybe caused by panic about the Wuhan virus? Baltic Dry Index also plunged, going negative for first time ever today.  It seems 2008 style economic catastrophe being priced in by both copper and BDI . . . https://t.co/8bVKbOQ9l1
