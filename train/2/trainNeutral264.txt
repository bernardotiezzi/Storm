@GatorsEquipment @GatorsFB Slant F over Gators Script. I like to mix it up. I‚Äôm tired of the same old Blue Jersey, White Pants, Orange Helmet. The 06 throwback against Alabama is one of my favorites!
@toylikelands @betts_on_fire @JingKelai @PmCasford @ashiabi_eric @RealCallence @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump CNN and all the other fake news outlets called it the Chinese virus first.
New York Times Blames Evangelical Christians for Coronavirus https://t.co/mLKQitRbhw via @BreitbartNews

After the Left asks to not blame Chinese for the CCP Virus, now they blame Christians! What hypocrisy!!
The MTA limiting service while just as many people still need to use public transit leading to obviously more densely packed trains is some real rinky dink city mgmt. https://t.co/2fEqKFUOpv
When any #Invention gets associated with the #Country of the #Inventor and #patents also mentions country name the #Pandemic should be credited as well. Otherwise it's just #Hypocrisy

@PrestonColbert A hard slant in the red zone hitting the wr right in the numbers is better
Everything is under lockdown so our environment is getting better. Air quality index in under 50 we can breathe in fresh air. As we our staying at home we must avoid snacks like chips and cold drinks.
Eat clean drink clean. Our body will also gets better.

@Coach_Monte100 Can only do so much when a 7 yard slant is either overthrown by 10 yards or thrown right into the ground lol
@StevePieczenik @ScottPresler @CLewandowski_ @realDonaldTrump @RealCandaceO @kanyewest Article is ostensibly about coronavirus organism. Trump's use of the term #ChineseVirus seems to have broader meaning. 

Will military intervene to stop conspiracy of US politicians colluding with Chinese Communist Party to attack POTUS & sabotage US?

@pratheesh_Hind @sardesairajdeep Thankfully practises like "nokku coolie", collecting payment without doing any work, didn't even merit a thought in other states.
@AOC You forgot some things
 - $25 million for the Kennedy center
 - $75 million for the national endowment for the arts
 - any business receiving aid must remain neutral in any union organizing efforts
