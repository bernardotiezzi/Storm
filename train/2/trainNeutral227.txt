 The slant is obvious.
Rodgers going 30-37 today is like the dink at the horse track who puts in 65 bets and "wins" 11 out of 12 races

Aikman quotes on last play of Packers 4 possessions~
“Had Graham”
“Should have had Jones on slant”
“Did not recognize it”
“Center exchange. What an error”
@blunderground @Slant_Magazine Oh, I Dared.... i dared hard.
@Hectorisfunny I never knew this, gives the film a completely different slant now!
#12 has to get rid of the ball faster on 4 man rush and no RB in backfield.  Short slant was there.
Rodgers throws the slant instead of the flat on our first drive and I bet this game is completely different.

Aaron “DINK & DUNK” RODGERS 

System QB 

Armchair QB 

Washed up QB
@jasonjwilde @DrewOlsonMKE AR holding the ball on slant when he HAS to cut it loose against an over aggressive defense. No deception action on offense against said defense. SF willing to run it all day and doing it very well so far. Not looking good.
Dink and dunk Aaron Rodgers
