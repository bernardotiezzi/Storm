@CarlBanksGIII Short quick passes can help move the chains but often times it is the deep passing plays that prove to be back breakers.  With a relentless pass rush you can negate those pass plays.  Look at how ineffective Eli was when he didn't  have time to throw and could only dink and dunk.
@CMOMaharashtra @OfficeofUT please think of closing down Mumbai suburban local during peak hours in morning/evening @PiyushGoyal @RailMinIndia 7AM to 11AM and 5PM to 9PM. Only way to confine Mumbaikars to their homes and force them into social distancing. Feasible? #ChineseVirus
I do if they are making under 30k a year. Either that or a moratorium on rents, utilities, insurance payments of all types. No need for them to suffer because the Dems Swamp created the Wuhan Virus https://t.co/bzVvJ7245V

@realDonaldTrump @JonahDispatch Millions, if not billions, will be made in the market over the next 6 to 12 months. It will take 30-60 days to get the stats that show the Wuhan virus affects a small percentage of the population (elderly/infirm) in a dramatic way. Then stock market rebound.

With the Fake Bubble Slant, the quarterback pump-fakes the bubble to the H-Back. This moves the defense up and opens a window for the quarterback to hit the Y on a slant.

@M4gni Wrong. Controller players can use a setting that makes them edit just as fast as scroll wheel reset. There‚Äôs no skill gap between M&K and Controller. They can do everything we can do. We just can‚Äôt triple dink someone. It‚Äôs all good tho
