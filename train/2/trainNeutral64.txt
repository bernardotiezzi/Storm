@marklowen @FrancescoTosto6 @julianmig Folate may help Corona virus carriers absorb oxygen by raising red blood cell count, specifically L-methylfolate, especially among Italians, Chinese, and Spaniards, who are at increased risk for the MTHFR Defect, which also causes inflamation and cardiac issues.

@Andy_mc31 @jerryshenk @DoughnutRespawn @Pappiness @realDonaldTrump You mean like protecting the U.S. Military that the Chinese are trying to blame the virus on? Everyone needs to know where it came from so the U.S. MILITARY ARE NOT BLAMED BY LYING CHINESE!

@90sfootball Scored so many “dink over the keeper” goals
Last Thursday in the Immigration office in Phuket I had to attend to renew my retirement visa. The office was full of Chinese from Wuhan (Immigration officer told me) but I was amazed there was nothing done to screen them for the virus; very distressing. https://t.co/KhRNJ7AXAH
