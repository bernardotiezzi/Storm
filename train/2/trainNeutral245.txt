@AkaTommyChubbs I start doing a hot rout to a curl and pass it low, gets them every time, or a quick slant
@nate4ks The Defender , plays on the WR and locks him in an animation running straight up the field , where if you wanted to run a slant, you couldn't because your being zombie walked straight upfield

@sciencecohen I'd like to know when will the "scientific community", @nature, @TheLancet, @sciencemagazine, @cellcell and many others condemn Chinese Government and Xi Jinping for HIDING and purposely disinforming about the virus???
This MUST BE DONE!
@mike_postino @NicolleDWallace @jaketapper When journalist insert themselves into a story by giving their opinions or omit facts to slant ones views they become nothing more than commentators. Very slippery slope. Makes one question their motives.
@adrismiklo @_Dakingg_ It's a broken mechanic that allows a user to lock another user when the offensive WR runs a route, so if I'm the WR and try running a slant, I can't because I'm locked running straight upfield
Potential slowdown in LNG exports due to coronavirus, but not yet?

Also note stimulus plans now being developed by Chinese authorities; look similar to previous infra/construction-heavy boosts - if so, will push resource demand up post-virus, whenever that is https://t.co/RhxmxvbexB

“The coronavirus is likely to have a bigger economic impact than previous outbreaks thanks to a rapidly growing Chinese economy and its deeper commercial ties to the U.S. In 2003, when the SARS virus hit, China’s GDP was $1.6 trillion.”
