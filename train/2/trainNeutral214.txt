@mlimakenya @ishaqearly @HarunMaruf @WHOEMRO @ayogo_do @awuor_job @LucyM50876035 @marywthuo @Mary37496707 Viruses do NOT have identities. It is unethical to use "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus"
Everybody has a role to stop this virus so let us focus on educating our communities on the prevention of #COVID„Éº19 rather than using racist language.
@scarfee_ All the time - I go back to the same places in my dreams while acting out different scenarios.
@ReaperDeathSign @yayaly69138046 @ROCKY_____TOU @F3ColdCuts @Chenzhiqi6 @zlj517 After strict restrictions,
how many infected tourists were able to travel???
Outside Wuhan-Hubei, the average number of infected cases is less than 1500 in each Chinese province. The virus didn't breakout outside Hubei in China. So why does virus breakout in your country?
Dark To Light: A Friday Recap 
The Friday edition of the show is upbeat, passionate, and full of good information. We start off by talking about the media and how they have begun to shift coverage on the Chinese virus.

@JimHansonDC Wandering why, for "facts", context and transparency, doesn't the "media" post this year's seasonal flu cases "reported" and deaths due to the flu, next to the #WuhanVirus numbers? Or the H1N1 virus, showing precedent? 
Is there an agenda? #ManufacturedCrisis?
@zoerebelle I do with a pretty girl.

@luluhypr #Dubai selling onions at AED 7.75 per kilo. All essential food items prices have been hiked cause of #CoronavirusPandemic. Please don‚Äôt be greedy at this point of time. #StaySafe #ChineseVirus #COVID19 #UAEFightsCorona
I saw the presser and the Q&A. Alexander should be working for a gossip magazine since he‚Äôs more of a sensationalist. #FakeNews indeed. #WuhanVirus #CCPVirus #ChineseCoronaVirus #KungFlu #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #DemocratsAreADisgrace #Trump2020 #KAG https://t.co/Z7WorbGsyO
@President46Yang @Karannautiyal9 @CuriousMan49 @Pandit_Ji_719 @NorbertElekes @MODIfiedVikas And when I referred to SARS, I was talking about the early warning of Dr Carlo Urbani which alerted the WHO and was instrumental in containing the virus. While in this case Italy kept allowing Chinese citizen in Italy for lack of info, now look where they are!
This summer, I'm taking my girl (future reference) to the beach, to the amusement park, to carnivals/fairs/festivals, go karting, laser tagging, the arcade, having spa dates, out on real dates, making sure her hair/nails stay done, traveling the world, and everything in between‚Ä¶

@TonyClarkCP Between magically changing early entry for gold pass holders then buckling to the #kungflu ( which has a 98%+ survival rate.. the flu legit kills more people each year), this is just nonsense. Poor business practices! I can see why your stock tanked harder than anyone else!!!!

@MrJonCryer Actually yes, Jon. I've gotten multiple raises, a promotion, energy prices are cheaper(even before oil plummeted), and unless you foolishly think the market won't quickly rebound once the Chinese Virus panic has abated, my 401k has benefitted as well.
Within the #NC population of 
~10.4 million residents 

~ 1.1 million in #MeckleburgCounty 

And ~ 1.1 million in #WakeCounty 

20 % of #NorthCarolina residents are in 2 counties

Try to keep that in perspective

@MarketWatch What would be better than a temporary check, companies pledge  job fairs: on the spot interviews & hirings for full time jobs that pay a living wage. From coast to coast, the service sector hit really hard, Americans blindsided by the #ChinaVirus.
