@___Rion3 What did sammy do that was so spectacular in these highlights? He caught a few slants and a girl that was it. On one slant he caught he was in zone and was expecting help and didn't get it. This video was a bit of a reach

Slant-flat has been around since the forward pass, but his quick twitch ability — paired with precision accuracy — makes the most basic concepts difficult to defend. https://t.co/EmA0R2jy1Q

Come when the rains
Have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice,
While the slant sun of February pours
Into the bowers a flood of light.
–William Cullen Bryant (1794–1878)
Watt down the line for Thomas, dinks it across, cleared. Offside flag then up when McKirdy tries to go through #cufc
@howroute It looks like a future mass grave. During the construction of buildings never lay anything at the bottom of the pit. #Corona #coronavirus #coronavirusec #ChinaVirus

@morton_emma I'm trying to put up a shower rail but with one of the walls on a slant
@NoDakPirate @MrWarchant @nick_vernald @Bucs__Report There is no 1st & long 99% of 1st Downs are 1st and 10. Short to intermediate easy throws are more efficient & successful than running the ball. If they can’t trust Jameis to throw a 4 yard slant or swing pass than the idea he’s their long term QB is absurd.
@NicolleDWallace @DebraMessing I choose not to participate in his teachable moment.  He seems to forget we can look up words and their definitions on google, without the ridiculous political slant.
@DesignsByPeak @MinkahMVP @Zirksee I throw slant he catches it starts running down field 97 Calais Campbell catches him little bit of too slow
Little old school WB Lions film Slant Pass Polnerow to Dankwah 68yd TD. WR runs the Slant and QB waits until he gets to the open window with the OLB dropping to the flats. Gotta love it! @WBLionsFootball #wingtteamscanpasstoo #getbettereveryday https://t.co/cs5DIU2Ja3
@JatNationalist @medsane @brawling_virago The virus droplets mix together in the air to form an aerosol which then infects through being breathed in. 

That's the gist of what they say there. I'm sure they go more in depth in the report elsewhere but my head hurts from reading all thos complicated Chinese tonight
Saving myself some money by not buying @IrishTimes. Was a decent paper but then on Thursday u see 7al articles plus the editorial giving a negative slant on 1 particular party. Bias is for free on social media, I don’t need to pay for it in the ‘paper of record’ 
@PatLeahyIT
@__TyBeezy We at Vera with it on Saturday 😂
@Giselleschels My room now is huge so I’ve been sort of lucky 😭 the rooms would be big if the roof didn’t slant
