I95, Southbound, today, Friday,  close to Aventura, Florida. 
In a normal Friday, this is bumper to bumper at 10mph, all 7 lanes. 

Today I was cruising at 65 mph.
What the poison from #china and #WuhanVirus did to US. 

But we will be back on no time stronger ever. @POTUS https://t.co/G72hg8K19m
When workers are left with no choice , no work , establishments closed workers will now go home to smaller towns and villages , this exodus need to be managed and emergency measures to stop the spread of Chinese virus is must
@dawg_lb @RacySicilian pandemic can be politically useful to stall a country's economy.

@AngryRetBanker @burdet_carol @YesTheRealOne_ @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump A commonly accepted name up and until the Chinese government started their propaganda campaign agaist the lable was indeed chinese coronavirus, wuhan coronavirus or simply chinese virus.  Simply because the mass media changed their narrative doesn't mean it's true.  Grow up.
For many pre-covid19 crisis struggling hotel, travel agencies, aircraft manufacturers, airlines and cruise businesses the corona virus negative impact may result in a beneficial situation for them. Like the Chinese say, it was a blessing in disguise 塞翁失马，焉知非福. https://t.co/gI96isNPwf

@costareports @chaitanyajoshi When Spanish Flu, Madras Eye were accepted terms in the past  accepted why not Chinese Virus. After all it originated from Wuhan.
@billjamesonline @Socal_CPA @keithlaw @thejd44 @MrPinkFloyd71 Whatever it is that is being called racist. In this case, people, but notably government officials, calling the virus “Chinese.”
@ChocoLa16874391 I wanted to see that back when the original release was in September. They put it on hold when we had back to back shootings. If it weren't for the damn Wuhan Virus, I would've seen it already.
@RedLobsterBoss @ryanobles @BernieSanders The slant reinforces the narrative being forcefully manufactured across our corporate media that Biden has this locked up and Bernie is considering dropping out despite the fact that the campaign has adamantly stated that is not the case.
@danbakley @peck_tj @HoneyBear4191 @DWagner85 @billbarnwell Michael Thomas has the best slant route in the game and one of the most accurate QBs in the game. Look at what Nuk did with TJ Yates and some of the other dudes they found in the stands to throw him the ball before DW4 got there
i don’t want to have to leave my house in fear that i will be attacked by a stranger purely based on my appearance. this already happens to many others without COVID-19 being an issue. imagine the hatred calling it the Chinese virus can perpetuate.
@digitalsista Corona Virus is the Common Cold.
(corona denoting the crown-like appearance of the surface projections) and was later officially accepted as a new genus of viruses.
Below are some recent discoveries.

His Pomposity: Tony I want you and Ben standing behind me for the news conference especially when I talk about the Chinese virus.
Tony: Ima little tired maybe I could sit until we get to questions?
His Pomposity: No. Standing behind me is better.

@avaxroy @aarontwice @_ReaalAmerican_ @washingtonpost Novel coronavirus pneumonia was not widely spread in January 3rd, and many Chinese did not know the new crown virus. Until January 20th, China's government suggested that the masses should be segregated at home
