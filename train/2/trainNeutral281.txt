@pulpyfictorious @Kiwi_Patriot Paper Mache when wet can be formed into any shape for drying.
How about a TP sword to cut thru the BS of #WuhanVirus #WuFlu?
@RaheemKassam Gates Foundation expenditures for abortion in Africa in 2019: 
$18 Million

Gates Foundation expenditures on #WuhanVirus : $5 Million

The Gates know that WuFlu isn't cause to panic in America.
@KerryKavanaugh @boston25 @JoeCurtatone @MassDPH Nancy Pelosi tried to sneak FISA reauthorization into original ChinaVirus funding bill -- 
is trying to sneak abortion funds into new virus funding bill.
We need testing kits NOW and she's playing games and holding up funds.

@abike1999 @lasa1170 @black_mixed @NittyNateR8R The description of the virus not surviving in animals or outside a human for more than a minute is complete wrong. There’s a Chinese bio lab in Wuhan so this was just informed fiction.
nieces btw :)
@realDailyWire @michaeljknowles According to Wikipedia the most recent official name for coronavirus  (or #wuhanVirus) is SARS-CoV-2.
(Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).

Unfortunately, most people firmly associate the acronym SARS with the country China.

Air quality would be something that wears down existing defenses - so that would depend on how many defenses remain in a particular person. Might be a great time to go on the patch IF you have a smoking habit. #Coronavirus #Wuhanvirus https://t.co/7Iqhhcz3Nw
@apizzaniko @KeuchelDBeard But you waited so long afterwards. Like when the whole situation started or when the punishments would've been decent. But it is March and the season is about to start. Get a new slant.
@chinky_lilthang Oh honey it’s a re occurring issue happens this time every year
@monoboxmusic @KimiMtz17 @F1 Global economic meltdown will have more serious worldwide consequences, including deaths, then the #WuhanFlu virus itself.

@JoJoWentBananas I would love to get myself second Switch, especially Lite, because portable but issues with analog sticks discourage me from getting one. I'll stay with mah chonky boi and his aftermarket joycons.
