Recurring Hong Kong protests represent uncertainty caused by the temporary basic law of the city-state, which lasts till 2047. In light of Wuhan Virus emergency, protection of the civil liberties in Hong Kong becomes important.

Govt should ensure that fatalities due to this lockdown isn't higher than due to #ChineseVirus. Economic & monetary policy is outsourced to the bureaucracy which is least affected by this lockdown

@geonuine @FairQuestions @CBCIndigenous @CBCNews The CBC news comments sections are outrageous in their political bias. Citizen's voices are routinely censored for simply not following a certain political slant. The taxpayers should not be paying for this in a free society. CBC needs to allow diversity of views or be defunded.
Annual Causes of death in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³:

The timeline should be updated to include the pandemic briefing when assuming office, the date Trump disbanded the pandemic response team, & the dates the Chinese started having problems with the virus. You can bet the intelligence community warned him then - if he'd only listen. https://t.co/gKUDmvHCxY
@jonnybhoyabides Yep I read something similar last week, it is why Trump turned up a week ago ashen grey, he had been given the bad news.
Another reason it is now the Chinese Virus.

The profile of this captain must be suspended at once. On one hand, the captains with careem status are unable to achieve your impossible targets for daily and weekly bonuses and on the other hand, such fake profiles stop them from competing in the number of trips.
