@dikell3 @MelissaRNMBA @johnrobertsFox @andrewcuomo The difference is I actually get to see the context and defense of Biden because 95% of our media is left bias..the only way the left will get to see the entire context (of things that are vital for our country right now and not just Trump saying Chinese virus) ..
@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump The Great Depression was a financial crisis and began in 1929 and lasted more than a decade. The New Deal was introduced three years in and lasted six years. 

The Wuhan virus is a health crisis and began in December. Its a completely different thing. 

See the difference?

@MarcyLane It's funny how she mentions staying inside with her husband - the magazine he runs has multiple headlines calling COVID-19 "the Wuhan virus". In fact, every single headline on the main page right now uses that same racist name.

Memphis running a great compliment to the bubble screen from empty. 2 WR side = Slant/Bubble. 3 WR side =  Fade/Stick/Bubble. I believe QB's reading the Mike.

Play 1: Mike outside box to trips = work 2 man combo.

Play 2: Mike plays deep Middle on Tampa 2 = work 3 man stick. https://t.co/eeUPgnDAjY

@tobeequal @realDonaldTrump Cheaper than tanking American economy. Most Americans have IRAs, 403Ks, or pensions for retirement lost 30%+ Wuhan China Virus, not controlled by China's Government to blame. Thousands of Chinese died in China because of epidemic. Blame China's Government, not Chinese, pandemic
