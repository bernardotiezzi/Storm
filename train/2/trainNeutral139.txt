"Daniel Hannan in the Telegraph welcomes the return of the bow and curtsy. James Delingpole in the Spectator explains why calling it "the Chinese Virus" is not racist. Mathew Lesh tweets in defence of actual profiteering." https://t.co/GxVHmJhWTV via @politics_co_uk
@dbirch214 @sjpdevine Some of the rainfall totals from last weeks low in the western Med were massive. Although the death toll has gone up with the Chinese virus, on Friday more had died in Spain from the weather.
The cases will fuel questions about Tokyo‚Äôs policy of allowing former Diamond Princess passengers to return home after testing negative.

New virus cases soar in South Korea and Chinese prisons, more die in Iran https://t.co/7uHUZnkFTU
@HelloDorkness Coronaviruses are RNA-based, which means they almost constantly mutate when being spread in an outbreak. Wuhan virus's cousin MERS kills 1 in 3.  You get a massive outbreak that mutates to greater lethality and it's a disaster.

@davidfrum More like Chuck n Nancy decided to add environmental and union worker demands. Tax rebates for solar and wind farms, stronger negotiating rights for unions, emissions restrictions for airlines.  Sounds more green new deal than coronavirus #ChinaVirus #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Two influenza pandemics in 1889 and 1918 saw three waves of infections, with the later ones being more deadly than the first cases, the outlet reported.

Although it's not related to the game, please remember to wear face mask and stay indoors as much as possible due to the #ChineseVirus / #COVID19 pandemic. It's the most important for us to stay safe in this situation.
