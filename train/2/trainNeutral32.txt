@yohechris @MoreMusic123 @johnnyscanvas @SPR34231 @darkangelmikel @TimRunsHisMouth @HillaryClinton Coronaviruses are a type of virus. SARS was a coronavirus. It has always been a habit to identify viruses by their point of origin or first identification. Wuhan or Chinese coronavirus is a perfectly legitimate name. Nothing racist about it.

@in_gloria @mochimomsc @justinhendrix @traciegirl6 January 31 is not the ‚Äúmiddle.‚Äù And travel restrictions only on the Chinese but not on the Americans who brought it here IS racist. He called it a ‚Äúforeign virus‚Äù further stoking bias against the Chinese. LATER he implemented travel bans from some but not all European countries
