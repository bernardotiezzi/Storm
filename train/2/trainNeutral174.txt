Lombardy is beautiful region with cultural significance that attracts tourists from all over. By the time visitors realized symptoms, the virus had reached entire world. Like noodles & gunpowder, the Chinese created the virus but the Italians enabled its widespread adoption.
@GojiroJPN @DrTedros @WHO @MofaJapan_en @WHOWPRO @JPN_PMO @JapanMissionGE @JapanMissionUN The shortage of masks in Japan is a serious condition. Many Chinese go to pharmacies and buy masks before opening.  The mask does not reach the hands of the Japanese. The Chinese are not just sprinkling the virus on Japan, they are also buying masks.

Guo Wengui (郭文貴) said on Tuesday (Feb. 4) that Chinese military news network Xilu claimed the virus was engineered by the United States, which is strangely at odds with what Chinese health authorities have said.
