This weekâ€™s Slant column covers what weâ€™re reading in the newsroom (romance novels, apparently), an urge for legislators to do something on the climate crisis, Rep. Peter DeFazioâ€™s State of the Union guest â€” and more. https://t.co/lk69R6akcL https://t.co/CUIVyCDrDq

A military spokesman said more than 24 soldiers and logistics personnel were quarantined because they feared they might have been exposed to the deadly Wuhan virus during their recent trip to China. Coronavirus spread to U.S. base in South Korea. https://t.co/SYhzCMXjHm
