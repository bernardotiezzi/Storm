A closeup of Donald Trump's news conference statement Thursday shows where the word "corona" was crossed out and replaced with "Chinese" virus as he speaks to reporters.

Words have consequences. trump repeatedly saying CHINESE VIRUS is the reason this happened. Look at the photos.  There are many more victims out there.  Their blood is on your hands https://t.co/TNq0Af3PLG
I say, I says I say... consider the source when hearing of ‘over the top’ news such as lock downs and the sort within the USA 🇺🇸

@jelynchjr Deebo Samuel Vs Sidney Jones. Can it be a quick slant or a reverse 😂😂
@sarinibanini @Kelly29Jason @rubk2017 @RACZPATT @AmbassadorRice @sarinibanini Jason was referring to the place like the Virus not people. Like Levi's are from US,  then they are American Levi's!! If the Wuhan virus is from China then is a Chinese virus! Stop this bs about racism! Bty, the Chinese are not a race!
@rangats @keel1616 According to the Kerala budget, the state fiscal deficit (நிதி பற்றாகுறை)  is around Rs 30000  கோடி  , which will rise to at least Rs 40000 cr due to the #ChineseVirus. 

With this special package, the entire  நிதி பற்றாகுறை of Kerala would be at least Rs 60000 cr... 🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
We're in this together...for the long haul...from a safe distance...right up until the moment I see you cough.

@dacoachmohuddle Qb power from trips to the boundary, TE attached the field. Inside zone from 2 x 2 back on same side of TE if you get a six man box with a over front of not audible to slant flat to the field and double slant, hot route to slant flat and read weak side.
@TruthInBytes The reduction is the natural decline in the number of business registration customers, or it has become 'non-existent' for some reason, which is where I suspect.
Our current misunderstanding of the Chinese virus may underestimate its danger. https://t.co/tZIgzpc45i
