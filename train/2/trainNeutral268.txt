@jabnolimit @HLAurora63 @BreitbartNews Attempting to concentrate thousands ventilators in areas where they are not needed will cause the appearance of shortages in areas where they are needed, fueling further criticism @POTUS is mishandling the #ChineseVirus response. See how it works?
@INCIndia @RahulGandhi It only happens in Delhi as a state sponsored program. Other state contained the migration. What method other than lockdown  would you suggest to fight Chinese Virus. Did you ask question to @ArvindKejriwal  why he failed to manage migration of job less family..?

Lockdown in Mumbai is only for areas except Mohammed Ali Road, Crawford Market, Bhendi Bazar, Dongri, Agripada, Nagpada, Kurla, Govandi, Bandra, Malad Jogeshwari. Are these areas #ChineseVirus resistant?

State Govts and local authorities to ensure orderly and socially distanced departure of immigrant labour and others. Please, please act responsibly. Think through. Don't, please, export the #WuhanVirus to other towns and villages where medical care is non-existent. 🙏🏼🙏🏼

@MrAndyNgo @BilldeBlasio @NYGovCuomo & @BilldeBlasio please advise on #NYstate & #NYC actions & inactions in preparation for pandemics like #WuhanVirus #ChinaVirus #coronavirus rather than #SanctuaryCity #Abortion #BailReform #IdentityPolitics

@NYCPBA @marklevinshow @seanhannity @dbongino @TuckerCarlson
@RealCandaceO The hospitals in NYC may be overwhelmed. The number of Flu cases may be more significant, but since every case is being looked at as possibly Wuhanvirus, that’s thousands of people going to the hospital instead of staying in bed at hoping it passes.

In 2020, most public holidays fell on weekends. People complained. Some MPs mooted a proposal of having such holidays pushed to the following workdays. The Chinese heard and sent us a virus. A month's "holiday" was declared. My son, people still complained!
