@PahadiRajput @gaurAnkitta @narendramodi Gaandu , you are bhakat, did you read my tweet.   I said when Modi allowed people like Kanika Kapoor and all who were coming from abroad to spread this Chinese virus after letting go by only thermal screening, why different parameters now.
@narendramodi @PMOIndia sir we arrange flights for Indians to return home foreign countries in this time of #chinesevirus
But we do not have buses and trains for poor daily wagers to go home within Bharat? They are not rich but they will vote. Pls remember that @BJP4India
@rob55059056 @junlinglin1 @Jh1bIPha3J5r8qd @OLE80756995 @PuneethPuthran @Devendra8080 @realDonaldTrump How are the Chinese people to blame? The Coronavirus is largely asymptomatic for days up to two weeks. Those that 'spead' the virus didn't even know they had the virus to spread. 

If you've gone outside your house then you are guilty of spreading by your logic.
@DUSKdev @TomaszBodek Vermintide 1 and 2 have some great and chonky melee animations. The swords get 'stuck' in the enemies for a fraction of a second, making the impacts that much meatier.

@rock_climber02 @gensettech @jburnmurdoch Factories (https://t.co/b7NHb7MWko) and shops (https://t.co/mft0ClAl5u) are re-opening, major cities didn't need Wuhan-style full lockdown because the virus was contained in Hubei. Life is returning to normal (https://t.co/BcCwlYKLkd), much more normal than the U.S. anyway ...

@22stephen @HoodlumRIP @realDonaldTrump Met with veterans, up close, until the end of the month.  Spreading germs, even though he knew about the #ChinaVirus.  Starting insulting and blaming Trump on the 24th...imagine that.  As I went through his tweets, I saw lie after lie.  @SenSchumer is a disgrace. https://t.co/TK7nXTOot8

@queenchristina_ @JamesMelville The Close ups in The Year Of Living Dangerously are far more entertaining than the non close ups of the Wuhan Virus. 1983, what a nice time before this A.I. garbage.

How other Metros have been able to manage this mass migration? Why this mass migration is happening only from Delhi? #ChineseVirus19 #WuhanVirus #Delhi
People are now allowed to enter but not leave, and many trains arriving on Saturday had been fully booked days in advance. Restrictions on residents heading out of Wuhan will not be lifted until April 8 https://t.co/cvme4F9vZj

Split Zone is a great play meant to look like Zone Read to freeze the defensive end for a kick-out block from the tight end or fullback. @justplayfb https://t.co/uRmnYNDhlL Visit them in #AFCA2020 Booth 445. Right by the Skills & Drills field. https://t.co/Y6zolCp1XW
@anant1017 @khanumarfa Journalist/public servant is already an extra job the person has taken up. Regular citizens must also do their part. For democracy to survive

Stop calling it Chinese virus. This is what gives birth to racism

Anyway
Our gov is not doing enough. Period.

@GingerLPhillips @CNN That thought has crossed mind. I keep thinking about the first I heard the story of the Chinese scientist who alerted authorities that this virus was released. They jailed him and he died of covid 19 a few weeks later.
