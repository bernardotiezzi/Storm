@PritishNandy @elopezgross @rohini_sgh @JeffBezos @washingtonpost Owners have substantial role in deciding editorial slant. It colours reporting, opinions & influences contents of oped section. WaPo's left liberal slant explains it's anti-Indian/anti-Israeli/pro Islamic stance. It described Abu-Bakr-Al-Baghdadi as an austere religious scholar!

@YesThatAnna Designating as off-limits in all contexts any word which has among its meanings a bigoted connotation is untenable. Words like "cracker", "oreo", and "chink" would all be prohibited. That has the perverse effect of ratifying the cooption of language for bigotry.

@SethM70 @MinkahMVP @Matt_IsAGod @LamarHeisman He throws alot of short TDs in the redzone. Which bolster his stats. 

Yall were best when yall ran the ball, he threw a little, but to salvage his stat line doug would call a Goaline check down or open slant. 

Tds can be deceptive, because some teams just run em in
