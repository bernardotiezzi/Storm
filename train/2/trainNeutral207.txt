@chonky_kantang The rendering is so beautiful 🥺
Just a friendly reminder @AOC is full of hot air and always seems to act in the worst interests of the #UnitedStates, imagine the progress we'd make as a nation if people like her weren't always obstructing! #StimulusPackage2020 #ChineseVirus #ChinaLiedAndPeopleDied https://t.co/9lag75ExSc
@GOPChairwoman @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump The delay of the overall nationwide response to the pandemic is also on her. If it’tnot her impeachment fiasco the whole nation would be able to shift attention to the Wuhan virus a lot earlier.
@folkdeejay @MartinSLewis I pay over a third of my gross company income as corporation tax, personal tax and collect a massive chink of VAT for the government.
Its not a 'tax dodge' its perfectly sensible when you have irregular payments amd can't pay a decent salary!
On Wednesday, Der Spiegel and the Washington Post reported that a planned joint statement by the G-7 countries on #coronavirus was scrapped in part because U.S. officials demanded the statement refer to it as “Wuhan virus.” https://t.co/XeCqSFFexu
Day 7: I’m actually viewing stories without skipping then

@Kemmajane85 @Malzyn2 @ghd_III @SenTomCotton Additionally, in January, take a gander at @washingtonpost front page - Chinese Virus. Are they racist? https://t.co/y2jPp1zFKd
One of the edits, per Mediaite: "Editors at the Federalist apparently changed references to COVID-19 in the piece to 'The Wuhan Virus.'" https://t.co/K18qI1DIQF
@katx01 @aurelius167 @DougCameron51 @AlboMP @Bowenchris You seem confused.

The bushfires were caused by climate hysteric arsonists and greens policies.

The virus is 100% the fault of the Chinese.

Labor loves the Chinese.

Start looking towards the left.

The purpose of socialism is misery.
$1200 payments for individuals, $2400 payments for married couples, $500 per child 17 and under. There is a lot of bs pork in this #CCPVirus #StimulusPlan but cash in the hands of actual working Americans is a good thing.
@TheRealXzerio @RAZ0RFIST Another example, you use the phrase "invoking his name" this a 'slant' tactic. Other then accepting the comparison to Twain's observation, you attempt to deflect.
@MikhailWashing5 @DakZekeCooper It’s funny that you say that because the slant king actually plays for the panthers... know the facts https://t.co/KEl15CGQ3i
@sgnitto85 @CaliRebelRebe @mitchellvii The problem lies in the fact the population density for NYC metro is higher than that of Wuhan China. Cram that many in such a small area and it is a time bomb for a virus.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Thanks for sharing the news!  Good job #Seattle @NPR - misleading information from @realDonaldTrump is good to keep away for the citizens health.  #CoronaVirusSeattle #chinavirus #coronavirus #COVID19
