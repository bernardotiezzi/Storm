@BarrettSallee Nope gonna try a back corner fade first. Followed by a quick slant and an option.
@reannessance @jaicabajar Novel Corona Virus
Novel as in new, nouvelle, noveau
Placeholder name for the then-unnamed virus. kumbaga sa thesis, working title. this helps prevent the use of 'Wuhan virus' which is a harmful name.

 i assume future coronavirus diseases will be 'novel' as well.
@fingersthe2nd @RavePigeon @lfisher314 @piersmorgan Never said it was racist.There is intent however. During these times, China is facing a lot of xenophobia and generalisation and ppl are stereotyping them... Thats why referring to the cornorvirus as a Chinese virus instead of cornorvirus is looked down upon. Hope u understand!

Then thereâ€™s me ðŸ˜‚
Even under normal circumstances, I believe everyone should read "Leverage Points: Places to Intervene In a System" by Donella Meadows. 

With the complex systemic problem brought on by the Wuhan virus, everyone would do well to put in the time to read it.

@TheMarkPantano It may be worse than 2008, b/c in 2008, the damage was centralized in the banking system.  This damage is spread out among hotels, casinos, restaurants, small businesses...#ChinaLiedPeopleDied
@sally_amaki Tall tareme (drooping eyes) shows more emotion than the short tsurime (slant eyes). The tall and round eyes allow you to be able to see characters being happy, sad, mad, or even cute. Tareme is what I prefer on cartoon characters, boy or girl. https://t.co/Bw2RmNjG3a
@VanishingPoin_t @Randy_Anglo The transition rates are indeed higher but the mortality rates is a difficult one. Deaths from flu are usually due to underlying reasons and those underlying reasons are usually noted as the primary cause of death whereas the same methodology is not being followed for Chinavirus.

It will be interesting to see if this time next year there is a downturn in weddings and engagements due to lack of dating during the Wuhan virus chaos... are people still dating like normal right now? ðŸ¤”
