I moved from Illinois in 2016 to Florida. Traded my fall allergies for the spring allergies here in Florida. Now I can't tell if my watering eyes, runny nose , congestion are caused by allergies, or flu, or cold, or Wuhan virus.

@Luminousthe3rd @Ms26116268 @serena9981 "Coronavirus" comes from the corona that surrounds the virions when viewed under magnification. "Chinese virus" literally pegs the virus on specific people.

Your last sentence: "Teach people to not be so sensitive about racism, instead of teaching them to not be racist".

@timor_LD @SpokespersonCHN Wuhan is closed on 1/23. This is transparent. It is now March, and the entire February can be prepared by the US government. But why are so many American citizens infected with the virus?

Lexicon matters. It matters during a crisis and stays long after it. We know the impact of words.

@nytimes writes administration officials + others are using “Wuhan virus”. This mirrors the pointed “radical Islamic extremist” usage. “Us v Them” doesnt serve us well. #COVIDー19 https://t.co/I1WjYOQdpw

@ZENINEWS The term Coronavirus is a classification for a virus with a single strand rna genome which causes an upper respiratory infection. The flu, the common cold, & SARS also fall under this classification. The Wuhan virus is specifically the Covid-19 which is a recent mutation. https://t.co/Kqc4QrzYPZ
