@JaiWolfx if you say "whAt AbOut the SpAniSh fLU?" 
it is also bad. it was only termed such in 1920, where medical naming conventions were developing. today it is called H1N1. 

calling it a 'chinese virus' discriminates against asian diaspora worldwide - many have no connection to china.
saturday's are important and fun for me personally because yeah we bond throughout the week - but it's a way for us to play games together and relax and make memes 

@tink_dink_, can't wait for you to get the children grounded
@RosenDustin @LowStakesDaniel @alex_jpgr @r2romasanta @josargent20 @Expertzero @alx @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @washingtonpost But it is factual that the virus came from china and therefore is logical to call it the "chinese virus" fact and logic. You are going about feelings of racism when in fact china isn't a race, its a country.
Our airports are very porous, some Nigerian came in from UK on monday and were not even screen at the port of entry Abuja we are at risk of wild fire spread of this covid-19.( Chinese virus )
@oarchibald @JerryFalwellJr @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump The resistant Democrats played a part in delaying a proactive attack covid19. The Chinese Dr. that reached out to USA regarding this virus, was arrested by it communist Gov and died in Jail. Trump has done the best he can with what he has to work with. @realDonaldTrump
@charliekirk11 In two weeks, when one hundred million unemployed appear in Europe and the US due to the fight against the Chinese Virus WuhanLabCCP, sobriety and the right perspective will come. With families, it will be 300 million people at risk of homelessness ...
@MaryCosg There is a slant I wasn't expecting.üòÄ
