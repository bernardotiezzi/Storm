@NFLinsider99 @thecheesefeed @KyleClark It's easier to remember these names. Can you tell me any of the 'official' names for these? Before the Chinese pressured the WHO it was called the Wuhan Virus. https://t.co/SNgJ7RMax2

"Week 10"- It started when toilet paper and water started selling out March 9th then before Friday the 13th snacks sold out as people died in Italy from a  Chinese virus that spread to California, I've had 1 of the craziest b-day weeks ever today on March 15th. @wbpictures
@realDonaldTrump At a time of great fear & danger which requires solidarity, humanity, sacrifice & hope ....President* “Chinese Virus” & #CorruptGOP sycophants have focused fear on the @GOP ‘s old wedge ...race.

The Trump admin says individuals and businesses will be allowed to delay paying their 2019 tax bills for 90 days past the usual April 15 deadline in an effort to inject up to $300 billion into the #Economy during the crisis caused by the #CCPVirus. https://t.co/g4VgDrDZdC

@CastleofCaul @oliverheslop @beachlove101 @sag1015 @ffajaz2 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Everyone is so quick to label things. Everyone needs to get their panties out of a wad, step into their big girl/boy pants.  It originally came from China hence Chinese virus. West Nile, Ebola, Spanish, not one person was butt hurt . PEOPLE ARE TURED IF BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT
"Asian Americans" Black Americans, Mexican Americans, Latino Americans, LGBTQ Americans, Jewish Americans, and the Indigenous people will never stop fighting against racists like President #Trump and his tiki torch followers.

@putyurdykin @TatumNdTequila The thing with Julian is that he can run virtually any route, so defensive backs have to play a speed out, drag, slant, post, fly, or even a screen when he lines up in the slot. That’s both system and ability.
@radiniqua @Joywesey The Duchess slant
@BarbMcQuade @TuckerCarlson Modifiers are, quite simply, any word or group of words that modifies (describes or elaborates upon) another element in a sentence.  In this instance, it identifies the likely source of the virus.  Are you worried about your Chinese donors?
