@miles_pf @Yuke35592928 @holladay_man @robertgknowlton @cr1spr @m01_david @Aug1_0 @Brasilmagic @mj_lee Point taken with MERS. Same with Ebola, named after that West African (?) river. The point is, NOBODY called this the Chinese virus. He called it that even after the proper COVID-19 name came out.
@DelWilber This was in the appendix to the sequel.

After traversing vast distances through that portal and being reborn as the space child, he becomes a Citizen Investigator and provides Important Secret Information about the Chinese Virus's origins in North Carolina.

@_AliveAlone_ @AbolishScum @d_davison68 @jeannathomas @RepJeffries Record stock market, record unemployment (a record means it betters anything previous to it), great gdp growth, etc. In sum, record economy. Borders are more secure- see numbers over last 12 months. NATO numbers real. Next you'll blame the Chinese virus on Trump. Or already have.
During this difficult time, the importance of all the gains made in economy and stock market since @realDonaldTrump was elected cannot be understated.

It is thanks to this president and his policies that we‚Äôre fighting the war against the Wuhan Virus from a position of strength.
@CFC_Arctic @sadlilstinker @yungstampsgod @CzechingAccount @utahbutimtaller @gabs_arrufat @HOOTwheelz USA: started a virus by touching live animals and now blames Chinese for doing the same thing. 

UK: is building mortuary‚Äôs, nurses can‚Äôt eat after 48 hour shifts as supermarkets are empty, I‚Äôve had symptoms for 2 weeks and can‚Äôt get tested but haven‚Äôt been told once to say home.

Or when he begins his remarks by echoing the racist term ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù https://t.co/2sgLnVnBhf
"Is there an inevitable link between "Still still choosing to study abroad" and "Relieving the burden on your home country"? Are the Qing students studying abroad to bear the burden of humiliation in order to reduce the burden on the motherland?" #China #CCP #CCPVirus https://t.co/lYZDBNJtkJ
The United States temporarily closes the American-Mexican border to all non-essential travel, in an attempt to tamp-down the panademic outbreak:

@DonaldJTrumpJr üáÆüá™ #Ireland timeline of the last few days.
March 15th: pubs and bars forced to close across Ireland
March 16th: Ireland creates a test for the virus that takes only 15 minutes for results.

So the #Wuhan virus was made in Ireland then based on Chinese logic? #WuFlu (sarcasm) https://t.co/6weKdXjTOK
@POTUS 
County press releases, city news, agencies, municipalities, utilities, libraries, hospitals, and on and on, call this virus either the novel coronavirus or covid19. You and your sycophants are the only ones calling it the Chinese virus. You're all ugly morons.
@JESnowden @KristinaSnowden If the ban on gatherings for events lasts 3 months or longer, what are the long time effects on wrestling companies? 
Do you think Vince calls it ‚ÄúCovid 19‚Äù ‚ÄúCorona Virus‚Äù or ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù?
@charliekirk11 @idylize Prime minister Trudeau said he is closing the Canadian Border to all non-essential, due to ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù not this ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù as Donald calls it

COVID-19: the name of the virus.

‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù: an attempt to deflect away from how poor potus is handling this.
@VioletIrwin76 it's surprising how many ppli see on my Korean phone while wearing my Bengladeshi shirt and my Mexican sweats complaining about the Chinese virus like we don't refer to everything we own by where it came from!!  not racist at all!  we ALWAYS do this!!  üôÑ Japanese eye roll emoji
