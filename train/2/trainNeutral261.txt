@AndrewLazarus4 @SeaEagleOne @NYGovCuomo @realDonaldTrump President Trump in the beginning of 2020 talked about the virus, while the Dems were trying to figure out how to impeach. Feb SOTU he warned about it. The press mocked him and called him racist discussing it. New York leaders told the people it's okay next to Chinese people.

@JanJekielek Factories face heightened #cybersecurity risks during #coronavirus_pandemic due to more people working at home, doing remote monitoring; increased production demands and fewer workers overall. IoT devices such as security cameras are vulnerable #ChinaVirus https://t.co/pdQZnx8Sak

I wear rubber glove and take a cloth dipped in a bleach solution with me to wipe my gloves if I touch or buy anything, when I remove my gloves I then wash my hands as recommended.  Cloth also used to wipe shop trolley. #NHS #Wuhanflu #chinavirus #coronavirus #coronovirus #Brexit https://t.co/Y9ZaVjzXYT
