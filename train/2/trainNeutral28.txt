@jpearlsoccer @ShawnMcLaws For sure, tackles at the bottom of the slant in to the fence.  On that field if working left and right foot you switched ends of the field with your exercise not balls to the other aide of the field üôàü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@plockplone @BoBosBack @sneezeman4 @texasborn96 @nhstigers12 @NFL @OU_Football @JalenHurts @nflnetwork 17 (20+ yard receptions) and 3 (40+ yard receptions) "not bad for 5 yard slant routes".  Tied with Tyler Lockett for 20+ yard receptions and tied with Julio for 40+ yard receptions.
@MathBomb I think KJ Hamler would be a great 3rd round pick (might go in the middle to late 2nd) extremely quick with good top end speed to match small shifty wide out that makes his biggest contributions on slant routes and posts also can stretch the field on vertical route with ease
@SpeakerPelosi Green new frickn deal solar panels, post office bailout, ballot harvesting, union deals...these have NOTHING to do with the #ChinaLiedPeopleDied  #ChinaVirus
Get real.
We aren't stupid. 
California knows you are lacking in morals and decency.
You're a baby killer.
