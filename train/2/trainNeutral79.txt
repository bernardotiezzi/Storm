@theguardianp53 @rmaali Personnel needed urgently elsewhere in Cina
The Plague of Justinian
The Battle of Waterloo
The Antonine Plague
The Armenian Massacre
The Great Galveston Flood
The 1931 Great China Flood
The Asian Flu
The San Francisco Earthquake

Many grim events named after place they occurred.

But, naming China's "Wuhan Flu" is racist! https://t.co/HhRelpmXAR
Atlantic City, NJ convention center to be turned into a hospital. Was just in there for the boat show at the end of February. Was supposed to be there soon for Beer fest. Now it‚Äôs an emergency field hospital. Crazy how fast things can change. #WuhanVirus #Covid19 #coronavirus
@NateBerkus It is always craft time in my home....from simple coloring for the younger kidos, to folding origami flowers for me. Lately I have been using permanent markers to make monarch butterflies on shrink plastic. Wow, Shrinky Dinks is what they used to be called, and still are.
World Health Organisation clarifies that there is no evidence  from the current outbreak that Garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

@AirAsiaSupport Hi AirAsia,

We have a booking (booking number: HRULNV) scheduled to fly on 15th March 2020. Due to Wuhan virus outbreak.
We have 3 young children age 9,7,4 years old. And taking care of our parents age 70+ year old. They are all depending on us.

@LindaWhaley Hi Linda, every Wednesday evening from 8 to 9 pm. We have a different topic each week and a quarterly review to keep the writing spirits buoyed whether progress has been good or less successful. It's social with a writing slant. All welcome. #writingchat
"Lower interest rates increase economic growth by driving up demand, while the disruptions caused by the spread of the virus are reducing the supply of goods. Cutting rates won‚Äôt address that ‚Äúsupply shock.‚Äù It won‚Äôt hasten the return of Chinese workers... https://t.co/Uore5HOmEX

@Concacaf @USWNT @fedefutbolcrc Rooney-esque dink
@rpruitt1974 @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump If it was a phrase, it would be a proper noun, hence capitalized, Chinese Virus.  Also, headlines drop words all the time to fit in space.  Is "toll spikes" a phrase?  or "and death"?  it is a headline, not a phrase

I try to drink coffee these days without my beloved sugar

@militaryhistori Montgomery might have commanded 8th Army in February 1942.

When Dorman-Smith told Auchinleck that Ritchie was not fit to command the 8th Army.

Interesting to contemplate, what might have happened, at Gazala, had Monty been in command.

P192 Chink by Olivia Greacen refers.
For people who are now unemployed due to important and necessary containment measures, such as the closure of hotels, bars and restaurants, the money will soon come to you. The onslaught of the Chinese virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!
@notsupermum Very well. I had my whole lower ground floor stripped back to stone and lime plastered, it cost a fortune as it is a slow process. I need to get on and finish painting, need to order some lime filler though as we've had a few dinks and problems after we flooded.
