@TheFlyingDweeb The stage length also played a factor in something else. It coupled with how high the top platform and how limited the options were for approaching it made camping too strong of a strat. There's also the giant slant which creates inconsistencies with hitboxes and spacing moves.
“Maher has an often thrillingly slant gaze, an eye alert to the absurdities, ironies and small tragedies at play in the manufacture of images and personas.” @amywaldman, no stranger to writing alert ... to small tragedies, brilliant review of “A Woman Like Her” by @SanamMKhi https://t.co/5QBdrhTDlH
@politico @WSJ @Reuters But once again amid proposals for broad-based cuts elsewhere. Including to CDC, though some $$ would be preserved for the Wuhan virus. Still, of all the times to recommend cutting CDC...! https://t.co/atGiuYZ23U
@RobertStorms84 “Why can’t the best picture win best picture?” 

If you make it so best foreign film can’t win best picture then if that is indeed the best picture as it was this year then the best picture won’t always be able to win best picture... you dink.

@vincentdangoth @zarahsultana @Oxfam Ownership and editorial slant are two different things.
I think many don’t really know about this...I get customers asking to change the charm at cons cause the surface is scratched. Please remove the protective layer:,) thank you I dec would change if it’s scratched even after you remove the layer https://t.co/kcTMlefKbT
@manda_dayoyo Ashes of love :,)
@Poosley_ I had a feeling this would happen. I watch a lot of those "possible catastrophes" scenario documentaries and in a few they mentioned they felt the next big virus would come from Chinese animal markets due to how they are not regulated.
