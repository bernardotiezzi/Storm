@Triplecharged @JLwRqHmiYigDCrs a danish newspaper published an article with a flag that had replaced the stars on the Chinese flag with corona virus.

Then the Chinese embassy demanded that Denmark apologises, and these internet warriors started spamming danish pics with nazi symbolism etc. on it.
Gunshot a blaze
@Chillin_out_ @4YrsToday I have noticed a tendency of commentators on the right to be describing COVID-19 as the "Chinese Corona Virus" everyone on the left calls it what scientists call it....why the necessity to add "CHINESE"?  Honestly that insistence to call it that sounds racist
Migrants who enter the United States illegally have bypassed the visa screening system that ensures that, for example, they do not have any communicable diseases ‚Äî like Wuhan flu.

@dotunadebayo @Tim_Vickery better than penalty ,hockey style tiebreaker is better where attacking player has to score goal vs goalkeeper from 25 meters in 8 second. Dribble, dink, shoot whatever @Minarzouki
Hoe s√™ jy vir 'n man jy dink hy is die best thing since sliced bread sonder om vir hom te s√™ hy is die best thing since sliced bread? Asking for myself.

@MarkHfx I spoke w/guy who was selling credit card company adhesion early February in a supermarket. We talked & I mentioned Wuhan Flu. 
His response was so quick: The American Military, now we know. 
I corrected him. 
Guy is Lebanese. So, I imagine it went wild in his community.

@1stCrassCitizen @hodl_american Ok brainlet, how bout we make a bet? You delete your account WHEN (not if, but when) the deaths from the Wuhan flu fail to exceed those of any normal flu season in the past decade in the US?  I‚Äôll delete mine if it does.
