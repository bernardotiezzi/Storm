@MelanieMbow @RicHolden @DurhamPolice @kitmalthouse Review the costs of the crime commissioners office when based against the former system of the Police authority. I’m sure that would be open source material. Would be interested to know your slant on that one

@Totalyscrewedup @CoulstonSusie @TheIronGiant8 @B49449739 @Alex_Kump @vincent13031925 @Reuters Occidental countries are not prepared for this.
Why? Because we have freedom.

Just that.
