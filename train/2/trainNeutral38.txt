@DroidAlexandra @ddfreyne That's what I find interesting about recent development: a large portion of apartments are not suited at all for multiple person households except for DINK couple.

I want to go to the movies today, just not alone; I hate not having friends out here.
@theMMQB @SInow @Tuaamann That’s too long to hold on to the ball for the RPO slant, the only throw he makes.
@BuffyWicks @GavinNewsom Since public utilities are guaranteed a profit, those who pay can expect an extra increase in the future after the Kung Flu hype is over. Also if your State is like mine after 90 days of non payment on rent you can take them to court, judge gives them 90 days to leave. Plus

@nytimes Then there were many Wuhan residents who worked in the Italian garment industry who travelled back and forth to Italy.

How long has this virus been spreading before China fessed up?

Go thing our POTUS banned all travel on Jan 31 to US from China.

He saved 1,000's of lives!
@TheFredGood @runbaja20 @josephtanst @RyanKJames @Crisis_x2 @LowStakesDaniel @alx @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @washingtonpost Calling it The Chinese Virus is racist and fear mongering. It has an official name and changing it to point “blame” is also misdirection. Trump isn’t taking accountability for his role in how the virus is also now an American virus. Racism as a scapegoat.
Interesting article (in English) on Vox voters in Spain. https://t.co/oA9GKQcnei
@SideshowJon36 @MileHighMonsta @BRasta56 @contfromprev @benshapiro @yashar The emergence location of a pathogen does not mean the pathogen is specific to that area. Obviously. It spread around the entire world. Now, if it were to only to have infected people of Wuhan then go ahead and call it the Wuhan virus. But this thing is international.
@netsbeeating 3 horizontal. One slant. One vertical
Why are New Yorkers allowed to leave their homes and state and travel freely throughout the country probably carrying the virus and infecting our citizens as they go?  New York and New York City is now the Wuhan, China of the United States.  This must stop!!!!!!
