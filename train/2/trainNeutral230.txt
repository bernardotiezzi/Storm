@basilewitch @YvonneHills4 Civil servants are there to advise about complete issues that a minister might not have all the information. They shouldn't put there own slant or hold back information, to get what they want. A real change is needed and soon.

I've struggled with Hittmanâ€™s films before but Never Rarely Sometimes Always shows a director completely mastering her material. My review @Slant_Magazine https://t.co/FY57DyFmBR
The O catches the D line in a slant away from strength, LT baits the DE up field on a pass set, opens up the H insert (Iso) same side dive for a big gain. #spreadoffense https://t.co/CqKgMTV0gH
@Goony_38 @docJ8six A priori, there's a 50/50 chance between run and pass. Now it's 3rd down and 3, the corners are in tight coverage and the safeties are too deep. Now the probabilities favor a slant pass and not a run. You use stats every play on the field.
