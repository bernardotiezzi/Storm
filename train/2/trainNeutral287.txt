Unlike in the West, where a Military's use is limited to 'Snow Removal' in Toronto, or aiding politicians out of flooded cars, the Chinese 'People's Liberation Army' puts their life on the line, actively engaged in a War on the CV-19 virus, delivering meals, medical supplies.. https://t.co/TzCG5HZnPN

@subschneider @realDonaldTrump He has to look like he is confident in his health until after enacting a plan to combat the Wuhan virus.  Otherwise it will look like he is only acting because of getting sick (or thinking he might be).  The alternative is to look like a coward who only acts out of selfishness.

@zugenia Also in a list “L”iterary slant: The Treaty of Detroit!
@daxlucas Common in media these days. Exaggerate or slant while providing some sprinkling of data to give a narrative a better chance of being believable
While not as many consumers are traveling, commercial goods still need to be transported, lowering cost of goods.   When the curve of new Wuhan Virus cases rolls over, the lower prices will be a welcomed respite. https://t.co/e8PrqzVy7F
