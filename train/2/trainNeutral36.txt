@sivakoratala I assume future will be like this..either virus or infra red sun blisters due to Ozone layer damage, or acid rain due to pollution, --Remember Chinese still eat lots of other animal sps getting continuous supply of virus. https://t.co/j1IZqeUXrW
@Kosta1987 @BaileAthaCliaD8 @talyn52 @Pappiness @realDonaldTrump I mean ethnically or legally because legally american ethnically greek. Also nice to see you are comparing yourself to a virus, great analogy... remember we call it Mers and Ebola as well so let's just be consistent and not get upset about calling it the Chinese Virus.

@_flaminga @n1k255kKOVF392r @zlj517 There are 2 species of this virus in Wuhan and 5 in the US. RNA sections can be recombined.
@sobeys reusable bags promote the growth of germs,bacteria and viruses harmful to public health because they cannot be effectively sanitized after each use. Single use plastic/paper bags should be the only alternate to reusable especially at this time of the ChinaVirus pandemic. https://t.co/13CiAaeqTI

@Ruby58813629 @connielinz @SJamesW63 @GreatScott311 @SemGeek @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Sorry, I didn't mean to offend. I wasn't actually saying China *did* call it the Wuhan Virus, I was just trying to make the point that China *could* call it that if they wanted. Cos Wuhan is a part of China. I was saying that Trump has no right to call it the "Chinese Virus".

@SilianMo @ChrisCastillo47 @realDonaldTrump The World Health Organization encourages and deliberately uses the term coronavirus to avoid the stigmatization of locations or ethnicity. Using â€˜Chineseâ€™ or â€˜Wuhanâ€™ in front of virus can create assumptions for people that Chinese people or the people from Wuhan are
"Itâ€™s aÂ shubh muhuratÂ on 24-25 March and the event canâ€™t be deferred". The fair(Mela) will be held from 25th March to 2nd April.

@Petrologica In short term, restarting economy will be staggered + in starts/fits. B/c of severe damage to small businesses, tough to expect to aim for return to pre-virus levels even in medium term (see Chinese business activity charts). Not to mention possible second virus wave in winter.
@Dink_Rountree27 @rod_bridgers Beat Reidsville with CC Harrison and the late Curtis Pass then lost to Eden Morehead. Still hold the BField record for most consecutive wins 22 or 23 I think. I had great seats every game ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚
At this point I donâ€™t even feel like leaving the house again
