@esseeeayeenn @HJoyceGender @Quillette Quillette specializes in contrarian views, often of a conservative or libertarian slant. Most contrarian views are tripe, because usually the mainstream academic view is correct. Thus, Quillette  publishes a lot of tripe. But it's not hard to see how they play a useful role.

@kempmat27 @LouisIngenthron @beatrix3506 @SaltyProfessor @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump You mean when all of main stream media was referring to the virus as the Chinese virus, or Wuhan virus?
@RealJamesWoods In 2008 it was the collapse of the housing  bubble.  2020 is a manufactured flu crisis. It seems one way or the other those in true real always find a way to steal our wealth and liberties. #COVID19ON #WuhanCoronavirus #ChineseVirus #Globalists
@Lucas1688 @RJ3811 @TaiwanNews886 Hazmat suits are  important for physicists and nurses facing  contagion threat as masks. And Taiwan is well stockpiled and well mass-production prepared for surgical masks.  Protect our men and women in front line well, and they will fight the Chinese virus for us.

@ryanclinton @gtconway3d Is this also why the corporate president who owns hotels w contracts for events now being canceled wants to blame the Chinese for the virus?
@AngelHe33778004 ARE WE IN THE END OF TIMES? HERE WHERE I AM IN PUERTO RICO WE HAD A CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE,WE HADN'T RECOVERED TOTALLY AND WE HAD EARTHQUAKES ANS STILL SHAKING EVERYDAY,THEN THE CHINESE VIRUS AND NOW ASTEROIDS? https://t.co/aC5wPTQOQX
Unless National Emergency is declared & EVERY  passenger flying from abroad is quarantined by default for a couple of weeks, the chances to preempt exponential increase of #WuhanVirus cases are SLIM

@Ptolemy_3 @steverey42 @MericaPatrician @travislambirth @DanielDumbrill @StockCats @NorthmanTrader Yeah, disappear people or imprison people if they say the wrong things. 45 milliom Chinese dead during Great Leap Forward. Accusing America of starting the virus.

If it's that insanity, I dont eant to understand, just like I dont want to understand Nazism.
RT BorisEP: During this difficult time, the importance of all the gains made in economy and stock market since realDonaldTrump was elected cannot be understated.

It is thanks to this president and his policies that we‚Äôre fighting the war against the Wuhan Virus from a posit‚Ä¶
