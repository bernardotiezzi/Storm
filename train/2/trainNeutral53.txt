For those of us in #NYC #NJ I know the rain coming can feel depressing...flip that switch... the rain will force more people to stay inside at home which is what we need most. 
Do a #raindance for our health.

Time for DOOMüî• Gonna hold off on RE3 for later because both this and Nioh 2 were pricey as hell (not helped by the CCP virus screwing everything up). Besides Capcom will release the classic costumes down the line anyway like the DLC‚Äôs for RE2 and DMC5. I hope. https://t.co/kYpQWQUl9e
@BigTrialBlog Sorry I have to ask you this, but is the "trial" for Msgr. Lynn going forward or is this put on hold also due to the Chinese virus?
@BlackHammerOrg @DonaldJTrump @nytimes @washingtonpost @CNN @FoxNews @ABCPolitics @AlJazeera @guardiannews @jonsnowC4 @ITV @Channel4 @Independent so it was a Chinese Virus then?!

@_Tanaeeee_ When‚Äôs your birthday?
@ChrisCoons @Delaware_DHSS Senator, thanks for your work to help us in this difficult time. However, due to the president racist comment, ‚ÄòChinese Virus‚Äô, he said. A lot of Asian Americans are living in another hell of fearing hate crime in this already hard time. Do something!!!

@watermicrobe "the chinese virus".
@andyopel @Ethan49930691 @LisaBon888 @KyleTims @12pats12 @Eelowan @SophiaHuang24 @_ReaalAmerican_ @AOC Referring to the place of origin or Chinese government isn't racist. Racism is referring to a people group, not a virus.
@1964andallthat Maybe two: A.C. Grayling for a philosophical slant, plus Richard Attenborough to add some insights on the innate wisdom of felines.
