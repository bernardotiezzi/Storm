Impact of #ChinaVirus Is visible on news papers. Weekend @HTGurgaon Has shrunk to half - 14 pages main edition and 4 pages HT City. Shows how much junk was getting created due to advertisements.
@SenateGOP @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump How does funding the Kennedy Center, NPR national endowment of the arts and refugees have anything to do with the Wuhan virus?  Why does congress now get a 46,000/00 a year raise?
My commuting cost to the office is 1000/week since I am working from home, I’ve donated 1000 rupees to   Pradhan Mantri National Relief Fund. 
I urge every Indian who are working from home to contribute some amount for fighting #ChineseVirus #CoronaUpdate #StayAwareStaySafe https://t.co/PPdsZJlbEn

@martinsystem51 @b_l_a_k_e_7 @Tampke @BethCHudson @AmericanRose33 @Animalsmatter9 @DanMurphy2018 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump Have you asked him his thoughts about China spreading the virus, now pandemic, around the world? Or perhaps Critical thinking might give him a headache.

@Shrinkie_Dink @pattibrosnan @heydjnash @AMillionABC I love every scene with Theo ✨✨ he’s so wonderful ❤️
@BBCNewsnight @maitlis @MarkLevineNYC Is this the same @MarkLevineNYC who recently urged New Yorkers to go to the Chinese New Year parade as the virus was bearing down on NYC?
@StephenKing @seanhannity My family was planning a trip to NYC during Easter Break back in  October. When the Chinese Virus became news back in January, I put the trip on hold. Thanks Sean for reporting the truth.
@BarryHoover @GFCACoaches Trap Right or QB counter left. Pass wise I like double slant or post/dig (left) with the TE drag.
@GFCACoaches 2nd & 7 is a good time to run a Power/RPO. Reading the Sam here to see if he tries to fold into the play or is contain. The backside viper should not get to the mesh.  C has to come off the Dbl if the Will tries to shoot through the window.  Z needs to run R off & X replace slant https://t.co/vMyM3nbEj9

@yokel_abductee too late
@haryannvi Govt can try to persuagthem not to migrate. Provide temporary shelter in cities. The risk of urban dwellers taking ChinaVirus to villages is high.

@GFCACoaches Defensively, bring the Sam off the edge and slant the DL.  Play 0 to TE side, play Qtrs/2 Read to 2 WR side.
@surnell @narendramodi @AmitShah Media gathers people for shooting as pre arranged and after editing makes a cinema with slant. We ate living without news papers.  why news channel people are allowed on roads with cams https://t.co/lNYK16FviT make a show?.
