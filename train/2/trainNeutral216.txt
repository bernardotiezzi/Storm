@ANB_ @RealSusanSwift @gabrielfoley @markets Anyone else here see huge slant?  Headline encourages the "Post hoc, ergo propter hoc" logical fallacy - "Trump praises drug, two people poisoned by it".

@phil_couturier @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party the roxham road crossing is still open, unscreened Interational flights arriving, but still hes more concerned with negative "social effects" caused by the kung flu than the kung flu itself.
