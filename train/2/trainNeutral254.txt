@Bnayakno1Md @random_interrup @statedeptspox @KatiePavlich @SpokespersonCHN How about this story, after releasing the prototype virus to the poor in US(the weaker version that caused the "Flu"), they finally decided to release the Virus in China,  unfortunately, the virus evolved to kill and get back, and Trump try to cover this by named it Chinese Virus
