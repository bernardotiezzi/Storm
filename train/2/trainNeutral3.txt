@ChadMcGovernUSN @juliealex1963 @bRedRep @Todayisanewday6 @davidpaulk @charlesadler @nytimes @WSJ @washingtonpost @VOANews @TIME Chad, you posted a clip to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that CNN has been calling it ‚Äúthe Chinese virus‚Äù.

@DanaBashCNN Reminder, right after he "read" well, and behaved, slightly less aggressive toward the press, by only calling the media fake twice, he tweeted out "Chinese Virus" so his braindead base would still love him. NO ONE WANTS YOUR OPINION, report the F*cking news like reporters used to

Chris Jones's impact was felt all game. On the right side, KC brings a full slant and brings Hitchens late off the edge forcing a quick decision from Garoppolo. Jones is able to read the Q's eyes and gets his hands up to swat the ball down. Kittle appeared open. @ArrowheadLive https://t.co/6HcTjmyTs6
@declankenny94 @dominiquetaegon CNN, New York Times, MSNBC, the Guardian, Vox, Washington Post etc (liberal or left media) all originally called it the Wuhan virus as that is most likely where it came from.
