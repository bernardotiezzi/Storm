@DCNeutron @evan_winter the QB can decide what to do with the ball based on his progressions and the routes that are available to him. JW or any QB in Bruce's offense doesn't get the benefit of a 3-step get the ball out play. Name the last quick slant you saw this team run.
With the Fake Bubble Slant, the quarterback pump-fakes the bubble to the H-Back. This moves the defense up and opens a window for the quarterback to hit the Y on a slant. #AFCAinsider

@chuckdelaware @billjamesonline There are video montages of reporters from various msm networks referring to it as the Wuhan or Chinese virus. The notion that it is racist is a political talking point that recently emerged and aside from being dumb is unproductive.

@capo_nj @w_queen_asia @tianlanm @gvn1071 It is not important for the Corona virus to disappear or not to disappear ... The important thing is for God to reward the Chinese nation for what it did in the Uighurs of the Muslims.
When you live in NYC/NJ you often have a disjointed view of events outside the tri-state area.. sometimes rather glib/smug.. 
As 1,000 of Chinese citizens die from a virus their leaders says very little about, we should take what @HalftimeReport says with a grain of salt.. idiots

Apart from Spanish Flu, these are named for precise geographical locations that cannot be confused with a group of people. By this logic WH should prefer "Wuhan flu" (and "Kansas flu" for the 1918 flu).

Use of "Chinese flu" perpetuates and exacerbates racist behaviours. Stop it. https://t.co/QSuUOQR3Ql

They found that the coronavirus was transmitted more rapidly in cities with cooler and drier weather conditions. Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, typically has temperatures in the 40s Fahrenheit during December and January. Last week, it was in the low 70s
