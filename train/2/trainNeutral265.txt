@Huge_Yakman @mitchellvii This has a lot to do with the time of year. First of May through the summer where most viruses are dormant is in your 75 days.

This opening is where an upstairs window will go. We had to put a diagonal slant on the thatch because otherwise with a 350mm thickness of reed, the thatch would have blocked a good part of the window. Slates or tiles wouldn‚Äôt have been  a problem. #Thatching issues. #Thatch. https://t.co/huhPN2rODH
