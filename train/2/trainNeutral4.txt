@davidfrum In modern biology and taxonomy, enormous numbers of organisms are labelled based on the geographic area they emerged from or inhabit. 'Chinese virus' or 'China virus' is correct. Should we stop calling it "North American Beaver" because it 'offends' delicate people like yourself?

@stephbenmca @neontaster So you are a newly ripened adult who is deciding to police language?

Diseases have a long history of being named after the first emergence, it the first reporting if, etc.

Ebola, Zika, Lyme's, etc, all named from origin.

Wuhan flu, china flu/virus is fine.

@TWKeene77 @miiioolsson @lord_igloo @AaroHirvensalo @MarkRuffalo @realDonaldTrump The Hebrew ◊ë can make the B or V sound. Google translate reads covi as Kobe because ◊ß◊ï◊ë◊ô isn't a real word. Zero connection to the name Kobe, in hebrew, covid-19 is covid-19. Let's just agree not to refer to it as the Chinese virus and cause hate on China from American racists.

@staines_andyjoy @PlasmaCamelot @dianefrancis1 @alexander_R27bc Not true: the "co" for "corona," the "vi" for "virus." The WHO deliberately did *not* name it for #China. Blaming the Chinese serves no useful purpose: they're as much victims as anyone. Diseases don't care about borders. #Covid19 is a #pandemic, meaning it's worldwide.
