"Scare" event necessary to bring about the #GreatAwakeningWorldwide.I know it's difficult to fathom as horrible things are happening to the Chinese people (genocide) but I believe what the CCP had planned with this virus  was much more horrible!
@IntelOperator Mutual defense treaties are triggers that may be used by enemy strategist and tacticians to their advantage; it is wise to assume that adversaries are examining all chinks and weaknesses of the armor.
@travisakers The 11th is not known for a liberal slant, either.
CGSS and its Affiliated newspaper National Herald Tribune (NHT) has started a special page in it's newspaper titled "CHINA GREAT NATION UNITED AGASINT CORONA VIRUS".The aim is to project the efforts of Chinese government on this issue.

@CoachDelgado61 @domehats @playfastfb @BillWiles1 Iâ€™m running trips field side  2 outside guys run hard slant/pic. Inside guy defender. Throw flat to inside receiver.  Back side rec. fade.  QB pre snap.  Look at defender on single.  Throw fade.
@CoachMac8740 @domehats @playfastfb 3x1, motion the slot in to protect with 7. Solo side has the jump ball fade, 2 man side runs slant by 1 and whip (1 step slant, then 180 to the out) to the pylon by 2. If the QB doesnâ€™t like the fade matchup he can take a deeper drop to let the whip set up

Gun Y-Trips Offset Fk WR Screen. Nice little variation of this plant where the Z does a slant and the slot receiver fake screens into that open space. Works well to set up the defense to overreact and if not, then the screen or wheel could be wide open. #NFL #football https://t.co/TeuZzscE4C
