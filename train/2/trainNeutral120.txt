but the slant in our pool is pretty steep and he slipped on it and went under. he was clearly struggling and was reaching for the edge of the pool where i was standing
@kachakhiladi @Pramodith7 A slant rhyme is a ‚Äúnear rhyme‚Äù. They are words that almost rhyme but break the rules in some small way. Used in poetry and music a lot because perfect rhymes are more restrictive. Examples include ‚Äúworm‚Äù and ‚Äúswarm‚Äù, or ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and ‚Äúphysicists‚Äù

Now all of them are expending a vaccine against the CHINESE VIRUS

Ironic ehü§î
@ShannonSharpe Good route and bold play call on 3rd and 18. That was also bad defense to allow a slant to go to the house. Did you think about high stepping as you got close to the end zone?

@July041776 I believe the Executive Order covers the delay of payments .. the mortgage companies and banks have to iron out the details.  (and they're asking Trump for money) .. it will be quickly worked out

@dragonsuplexK1 @midvale1945 @eugenegu @WordswithSteph @DrPaulGosar I lean towards the left more and i would definitely call it the wuhan virus just like most pointed out all those other names but i want to add in rubella which is nicknamed the german measles and imo thats actually worse than ‚Äúwuhan virus‚Äù so its really no problem.
