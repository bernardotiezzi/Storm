The well healed complaisant Media even at our time of need assists foreign powers. Their personal prejudices within their questions shows. They should be supporting our own Government in a dangerous deadly world crisis

I always stay home, play video games, watch videos and check social apps.
Now that I have to stay home I'll change it up. Watch videos, check social apps and play video games.
#SocialDistancing is my life.
We introverts have this down.

@JoyAnnReid @NYGovCuomo His daily briefings remind me of FDRs fireside chats. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúCoffee with Cuomo‚Äù I feel much better listening to him, then Trump comes on after and I about have a panic attack. First words...‚ÄùChinese Virus‚Äù then yells at reporters and gives false information on drugs out.

@secupp @jaketapper @OANN @washingtonpost Yet every year there is a White House correspondents dinner and then former advisors for different presidents get hired by news networks, like @GStephanopoulos.  Any wonder why people think the media has a slant on both sides?
@motokorich When I was doing street interviews in Tokyo late January thru late Feb.  - including for a front-page piece in the Times - the people I spoke with commonly referenced it as the "Wuhan flu/virus". Indonesians, Taiwanese and Japanese. 

All before the blame game spat started.

@JasonWSchaver @TheThirdColor @EllenBookstore @seanhannity @maddow @MSNBC @biden I disagree! Prior to the #ChineseVirus the country was in great shape. The mouthpieces for the @DNC couldn‚Äôt stop talking about how bad it was. FYI I‚Äôm an independent voter. Voted for Obama the first term.

@BafienMorin @dador92 @chenweihua @isaacstonefish From January to March. 6 weeks, how many things you could do in 6 weeks. You got the DNA, the sample, even the strain. You saw thousands people died in China. You saw what Chinese and Korea government did to control the virus. At the same time, there are few infected in America.
