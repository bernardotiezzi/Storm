@SkyNews What if my car needs an MOT but the garage is closed because of coronavirus ? I ask as my car is booked in for the 28th March as the MOT expires 4th April

stepped away from the bong
put down the cup of Jo
Slipped into my Birkenstocks
Shins exposed only shorts
Grabbed my ushanka

Snuck outside to enjoy the Bay Area downpour of rain smoking a stoge

Shotgun in hand
Daring the coronavirus to step on MY LAAAWN!
