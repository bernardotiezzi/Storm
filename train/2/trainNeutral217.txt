@MaureenDalby Italy, in the North, has many factories/workshops manufacturing leather goods. In recent years these have been taken over by Chinese and there is a vast Chinese population there. Many will have gone back home for their New Year celebrations, bringing back the virus. Beginnings
Traders of SP Road, Avenue Road and surrounding areas which is a hub for industrial, electronics, garments and other supplies will voluntarily lockdown starting tomorrow till 25th (perhaps provisionally) #WuhanVirus #JanataCareForYou
@markkelleyclark @realDonaldTrump @SBAgov Maybe but be glad he is at the helm. He is a terrible speaker at these Daily briefings but the people around him are top notch. They have a great team assembled rather you like it or not. Oh by the way it is the Chinese virus.

@bigbendcoast @august_mk @ConradMBlack @nationalpost if borders had been strictly controlled at end of January when severity of Wuhan virus known, and thorough screening required, then we would have saved ourselves this horrendous situation.

@MyAwkward11 @NathanEastCoast @dragonzorddown1 @doeboy531 @Robert_Fiore @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo By the way - look at your third definition.  Assigning Chinese to the virus definitionally suggest its intrinsically attributable to the Chinese; again, case closed
Assam Govt announced $2000 monetary relief for residents who travelled abroad from the state in the past 30 days and are now stuck there because of #ChineseVirus and travel restrictions.

Assam govt will stamp anyone who enters the state by rail/air from March 22 onwards. #Corona
@Larry_Renforth @KoenCjkoen @Akpilot59 @tianabelle @DylanJCross92 @Politics_Polls @HarrisPoll This is where context is important when analyzing Trump's actions. 

Key context here: Trump only began calling it the Chinese virus *after* the CCP came up with the bogus claim that the US Army brought the virus to China. He's using the phrase to fight the CCP's propaganda.üá∫üá∏
Goff man... pre snap motion shows defense is in man, and on 3rd and 6 he bird dogs the 2 on an out even though the timing is messed up and he has a one step slant backside vs C1 with the rat dropping from the opposite side. Not even gonna comment on the pocket movement... https://t.co/PDuYWlP7Ng

@JYSexton JANUARY 21ST, JANUARY 21ST, JANUARY 21ST, JANUARY 21ST, JANUARY 21ST, JANUARY 21ST, JANUARY 21ST, JANUARY 21ST! First day China /WHO shared information on the CHINESE VIRUS! Americans DONT BELIEVE YOU!
@MrsRabbitResist I will admit that I actually enjoyed it, especially seeing a "Once Upon A Time" slant to the story line...and yes, the last bit was very intense - but...üé∂"That's Tarantino!!üé∂. It was also "fun" as I knew what actually happened to seperate the actual from the "once upon a time."
@Reaproy @KhaosodEnglish @MFAThai @Thai_Talk @prdthailand @ThaiEnquirer @RichardBarrow @BangkokPostNews @nationnews @WHOThailand @WHO @pauldrisley @hrw I agree with you, but its inaccurate name may mislead it origin. Chinese has taken advantage of this. 
That's why I want to call #ChineseVirus
@_Marz101 @eddiefuentes_ @NanieSanchez I usually cut it at a slant but I was lowkey in a rushüò≠üò≠üò≠
Trump resisted domestic preparations in part due to "his relationship with [Xi], whom Trump believed was providing him with reliable information about how the virus was spreading in China, despite reports from intelligence agencies that Chinese officials were not being candid."
