@jordanspurs I think it‚Äôs funny that he tweets. Like he tweets about stuff as if he‚Äôs a normal person, living an ordinary life. üòÇ the Chinese Virus is hilariously stupid though. What the hell drove him to the point to call it that
And the plot thickensü§≠ https://t.co/WXSM8Rqpqo
Gee, you mean like this? https://t.co/0LyFppQzGX https://t.co/dCjd2oJdUT
Worst hit during #21daylockdown #Lockdown21 :-

 - Daily wage & migrant labourers
 - Taxis & radio taxis
 - Hotels & restaurants
 - Logistics & transport
 - Small time businesses - shops, dhabas, etc.
 - Salesmen

... No pain is lesser.

I just started reading a 2007 book. 

The reviews say that ‚Äúnobody sees the future as clearly‚Äù as the author.

Within the first 11 pages, it outlines the plot as being about an outbreak of a respitorary disease virus originating from a lab in Wuhan... https://t.co/Bc0hAqplOD

Customs, immigration people where there when Chinese plane and passengers where cleared to enter the country. The magnitude of the Corona virus is no joke. @FredMatiangi

@sianetta @SenWarren @WhiteHouse @FoxNews Please add: Disease name - American liberalism, Place of origin - United States of America. 
Spread across the globe beginning in 2016, infecting millions, ruining countless lives. Multiple deaths. 
Still no cure.

poem no. 3
[?]

do i say it straight
or do i say it slant?
bc i‚Äôm afraid
what‚Äôd happen‚Äôs 
not what i want

i‚Äôm not so sure
if ur mind‚Äôs opaque
bc i‚Äôve made
none of it obscure
or close to vague

what if it‚Äôs an act
i may be wrong
and u could
have known it
all along

@star2nite2000 @cnnbrk Remember when everything to do with the economy and stock market were going great? Then the #ChineseVirus made it‚Äôs way over here.... This is not #Trumps fault. All you on the left just want President Trump to fail. #Butatwhatcost
@breakinant @AR_MegaMan At least in some of the timelines there's momentary peace like with pre-Copy X's Neo Arcadia, ZX, and Legends. Though, they really don't make up for the other parts of it being riddled with bloodshed and endless war.
@UsAgainstTrump @St3v0_24 @cwil91 @Gil_Brandt He completes 66 percent of his passes and averages 11.6 yards per completion that‚Äôs hardly dink and dunk. Have you even watched the Cowboys at all the past 2 years???? Dak has ran the ball an average of 3 times a game.
