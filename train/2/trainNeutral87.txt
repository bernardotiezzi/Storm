@Leanne_Cee Hi Leanne,
A couple of questions:
1. Why does your latest tweet always appear first when I login to Twitter?
2. Did you hear Trump call Covid-19 'the Chinese virus' today? The Chinese went mad!

@DavMicRot @realDonaldTrump Says David Rothschild, from one of the richest family dynasties in the world. His family doesn't worry about owning properties because they own entire countries. Make no mistake, his family is behind this Wuhan virus, they literally are the NWO.
