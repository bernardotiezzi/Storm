Flu season started in the fall, about a month before the #CoronaOutbreak ... While the Corona is (probably) more contagious, there’s absolutely no proof that it has higher mortality...  Many with #ChineseVirus don’t even know, because they’re not sickened! https://t.co/u0DwATXto7
#Amazon, #Apple, #Google, #Facebook, #Microsoft, and #Twitter have all agreed to continue paying their hourly workers if they are asked to stay home due to the #coronavirus.

@PolitiKurd This is an emergency, not a long-term plan, or one that is deemed to be sustainable.  Wartime measures are wartime measures, not “socialism”; emergency, or crisis, measures likewise.

United and American Airlines halted flights to Hong Kong and 10 people on a cruise ship under quarantine in Japan tested positive for the virus, as more Chinese cities imposed restrictions on movement and deaths from the fast-spreading pathogen neared 500 https://t.co/KdkoyArC0M
@Coach_Timmerman Reading the coverage. With athletic qb can easily make it a triple option with qb pull. Quick read on slant/flat. If not wide open give.
@PhantasyPhiend @DouglasVilliar2 @yeezyeezy234 @JediOnWelfare @PaigeSully88 @RepSwalwell @weijia I do all of those as well I love a good game of chess. But I also try to find time to keep on current events. Since you use Twitter I’m sure you have seen msm on here. Which means you have read Wuhan virus in their headlines.
@PhyllisNetzer @BusyBeaver12 @maryschool_mary @newtgingrich Oh federal funding of abortions and green house gases are key to the relief package for the kung flu?   Never mind Phyllis, hope the boomer remover doesn’t get you.  And enjoy 4 more years of Trump as your President.
