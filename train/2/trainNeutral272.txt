@neeratanden @joshtpm Virus excels with nyc feb/ March type weather and humidity.  It also excels on latitude line. Nyc in same line as wuhan.  Coastal areas like shanghai not nearly effected.  Far bigger than beaches in Florida were nyc bars crowded st Patrickâ€™s day weekend
A military convoy in Italy is carrying #coronavirus victims to a crematorium. Due to lockdown to prevent further contagion, funerals are not allowed. This will be the only respect that these victims will receive.

Heartbreaking. ðŸ˜¢ðŸ’”

@IndianExpress They allowed a lot of tourists.  From Jan 13 to Jan 24, 50 million tourists travelled to and from EU, US to Wuhan, China, and back.  None of them took any steps to screen or quarantine them.  WHO is also the black sheep which said there was no need for screenin for virus ðŸ˜·
@CHIZMAGA @SpeakerPelosi @NYGovCuomo & @BilldeBlasio please advise on US #NYstate & #NYC actions & inactions in preparation for pandemics like #WuhanVirus #ChinaVirus #coronavirus rather than #SanctuaryCity #Abortion #BailReform #IdentityPolitics

Students from the North-East who went to a super market were denied entry in Mysuru

This is the effect of using racist de-humanising terms like 'Chinese Virus'

Citizens from NE will face further discrimination. Strict action should be taken to stop this.

@narendramodi @BSYBJP sir. Please make arrangements to deliver groceries and vegetables to houses to prevent people stepping out and risking the spread of #chinavirus. It's the most critical phase where stringent lockdown is required.

@DelightNdlovu10 @IOL No, attending or not attending a funeral during a lockdown in efforts to try and contain a virus is a personal choice.

Those Wuhan people were put there by the government it was not their choice, they wanted to go home but gov said before they do they must be quarantined.

@janelson38 @Willie700WLW Wasn't aware of the racial aspect - one of my brothers lives in New Orleans, they always go to Mardi Gras & he said that's what did New Orleans in re Chinese virus
@Ted47983158 @trump_noodle @IminHisbook @NYGovCuomo @POTUS Right .. never mind ..  easy to say when not in the epicenter thanks to De Blasio & Cuomo wasting 6 weeks .. between travel ban & taking the virus seriously... maybe the Chinese New Year â€˜s parade that exposed thousands of NYC residents to the virus was just fine

@NIHDirector First important difference is what is highlighted in between two orange lines in Figure 3. Clearly, this part of the Wuhan coronavirus spike differs significantly from those of the bat virus spikes, despite the overall high identity between them.
