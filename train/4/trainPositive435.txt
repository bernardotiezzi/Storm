@ImWendy Good morning.  Hope you are having a super Tuesday!  
Day 6 and I'm feeling pretty good   I think it's time to do some spring cleaning though - everything smells like smoke. . .
Was overwhelmed and ecstatic with all the lovely faery love &amp; wishes that my fabulous faery friends sent me last week...truly uplifting 
two of my most important projects are due today....i can finally breath

@scottbird slightly, it's the special type of weakness when your only exercise is picking up a 12lb baby.
