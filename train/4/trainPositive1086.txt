First day out and about wore me out. Need some mango sorbet and a nap now. Got some beautiful beach glass beads and a sunburned nose. 
@zeegirl602 Uh... If you think that'll help, I s'pose... 
I feel better now 
@mckelvaney It's very boring, but will all be over on Wednesday! ..until exams. I'm doing a history degree.

@s0ni So, I'm thinking I might rent a car in May and take a road trip with the rugrat to come visit you in hell AKA Texas. 
@babybritt721 Hope you're having a good weekend. Remember, no more work till Monday! 
@LordSnakie Good job, I like it a lot and it certainly fits well with what Bungie would do, doesn't seem over the top
