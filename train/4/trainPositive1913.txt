Doing some school stuff..i want to be on a sunny place on earth with some ice cream 
@DashboardChris  awesome!! you've inspired me to get my SG out after i write this essay 
What a wonderful sunny day, I bought something for myself  (hair band and victoria style dress~)
@darkanimelover sure thing ^^ i have blank cds here @ my house, &amp; i dont have anything to do, so i'll just burn it now 
@honestlyShelby someone's a little twitter happy ha 
@brucebski  I've done that in the past, but have felt so weird doing it. Maybe it's time to do it again 
@juliawhatever --no worries, you might catch me going over so ditto on the upfront apology--but no need, I love you (all) unconditionally 
@shondarhimes Yeah. I can see that.  I wonder if having sites like @PaddyMustTweet will influence them. But who knows 
@BrendanDeBeasi yes yes yes 
Listening to Jeff talk about twitter 
@phdota Can't help you with that. Paybox seems to be defacto standard in Austria. If you want to use that service, sign up. 
@GeishaShae I would definitely read that. Good luck with it 
@jjpadvis Sounds just like me
