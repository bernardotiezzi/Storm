No much traffic at the vacation time, but the few cars are driving more than crazy. Most germans are very agressive drivers.I miss Canada 
Went to Calgary with some of the lads (Gaspar had to sit in the boot  ) to watch the Flames versus LA Kings. Calgary won 4-1. Nice night.
Once, I told him a story about ghosts being in my room.. For days, he talked about being very afraid. This kid knows how to heal himself. 
I'll sleep well tonight.... If the missus doesn't kick me out for being so late home, that is
