This weekend was awesome! I miss everyone already, especially that adorable creep of a mad scientist 
watching NCIS. Is it the grey hair that makes Mark Harmon so attractive? I think so. 
Impromptu party. Modest mouse and beer. 
Did quite a bit of work for my mom today.  Organized her bills and such.  Tired and retiring early tonight.
