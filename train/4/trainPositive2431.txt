Sunshinyy day! Woot 
@tori_stokes  give us a chance  just a few minutes ;) hook me up on WAYN and will show you around 
Going 2 do somthing else other than Twitting-all-day-long. Probably will soon be back... 
Just got up... Chocolate cheesecake for breakfast i think 
So I'm tweeting and including my daily food intake.  Virtually food diary.  
Everyday ought to be a day of anew and progression..&quot;that's how I see it&quot;!!!! GoodMonday 
@Sherry78 GOOD LUCK!   PB it, girl!
Slowly waking. up...I'm so not a morning person 
Holding on to dear life for these last two hectic weeks of class and finals... Then it's freedom!!! I like freedom... 
@njvinnie Does this mean you're joining me in my 6AM killathons? 
@LeftCoastGirl good morning to you, aim me when you're not busy working 
Lucky me... I got a request for legal services from a dubious Chinese company... does getting targeted by scammers show you've arrived? 
I'm ready to go home and cuddle.  It's so chilly outside (And in).  
@AMM31 you wanna crank that souljah boy  LOL do the stinky leg in stead LOL  http://bit.ly/lsJSg

@Sugarwilla i am both...bitter sweet kinda thing...although it will be nice to get back to my normal lifestyle and my house 
A Tweet Deck is a dashboard of power,A noun letting twitter less sour,As typing devours into poetic showers; Personally smile for hours!
