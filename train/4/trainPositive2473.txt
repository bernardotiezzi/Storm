@bigcam01 Well it's an idea if it would make life easier for me. Large garden and I HATE gardening. Go figure... 
It was a good weekend, we watched Crank (the first one), moved in new furniture, and was allowed to catch up on sleep.  I can't complain 
today would have been the best day to sleep in .. but that didn't happen because penny &amp; otis are way too annoying in the morning.
