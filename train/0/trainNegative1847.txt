someone take me to see demi lovato on july 6   
Looks like no activity from me till 26th 
I really would like to download @Tweetie, but I sadly have a Mac running 10.4  
Missing my phone, which is at the bottom of the lake, and the marmet is playing with it blissfully 
Very angry. Car got fixed, car broke again.  And the 'rents won't lend me one of theirs! 3 cars, 3 people, everyone should get one!
@ChanelDiane ROFLMAO. THEY need to turn that shit into a real song.. Poor girl she only 21 too and crazy as hell smashing homies 
@girlnamedsam Holy cow, they are ripping this off from years ago.  : http://tinyurl.com/v4h2z
My results section is sad. We had no statistically significant findings. An experimenter's worst nightmare. 
I need some ideas to put a poem together. I haven't written a good one in months.

*Kicks her twhirl* It's stuck!!! 
It's only Monday night and I feel like I am Friday-night tired. 
I'm never using nose strips ever again. It peeled off some of my skin! Now it looks like my nose is burnt 
I am not excited that it is 1:51am and I am doing laundry... 
@mel_tigger Gee, thanks for spending the morning making the world think that I'm a slob 
@satinephoenix ? I though I was following you before... Damn computers...  Oh well. Am now. 
chillin in my bed watching thin line between love and hate ..... one of the bestest movies in lowkey pain

@pet2107 Everytime u say u love me, it sounds more like white noise, feels like a sick mockery  Why do you persist?
