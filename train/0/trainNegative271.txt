@JoanneSkywalker It's really depressing!!! It teases me, by working fine up until I try to save the people I created. What the hell! AHH! 
I feel like DEATH.  My throat hurts.
@thecrochetkid I'm too poor 
I'm really sick  I have to go get a bunch of tests at the doctors today. They think it might be lyme. I'm really not excited about this...
I was stuck in bed all day yesterday with the most savage of migraines  Was absolute torture... Anyone else get something similar at all?

@NowGamer_Dan and for the xbox360 even 5.9/10  I hope that I will disagree with that next week when I get the game ...
Really missed you last night 
Watched Cannibal Holocaust last night and had screwed up dreams. That is not a movie for the squeamish. They kill a real turtle
