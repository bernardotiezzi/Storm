@pebbles1066 what's stopping you? 
Watching @LJRICH on the tv at work. No sound though only subtitles 
I never get tired of listening to awesome Wicked tracks. &quot;But that doesn't soften the ache we feel, when reality sets back in&quot; 
@tinkslovesj have you seen that Sky+ app? lets you control stuff from your iPhone! I'm into Gossip Girl ok?I'm not proud if it 
Nice long sleep the night before I need to get up in the middle of the night? No chance. Ill children kept everyone awake half the night 
fuck. wanted to go to Awakeri hot pools with emma and some other friends but can't get a ride back in 
Heading to bed.. So uncomfertable; feels like 1000 degrees of heat is coming out of my skin! Beach+no sunscreen= bad news 
i'm starting to get infactuated with him. i try my best to talk to him, but i guess i got shy today 
My night started out so much fun.. ended in a frantic call to Go &amp; Hil, followed by a stealth rescue. Guys in Iowa are weird, dude. Fuck. 
@ash_riot i miss those days 
&quot;Soft swirls of cherry bliss with a distinct pouty peak!&quot; I have fallen in love with pinkberry and we don't even have it over here! 
@GLAMOROUSVANDAL I have a bad cold, the weather went from warm to very cold... it's winter here soon... i can feel it 
Random rap videos in the background. BET is in great need of a LIFT. Something fresh. Like real talk. Its becoming @theworse.
