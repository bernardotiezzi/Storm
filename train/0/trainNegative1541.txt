Only got 3 hours of sleep, and I woke up to an upset stomach. Today is not getting off to the best start. 
First day back at work after a weeks break. Am I looking forward to it, well what do you think ?

I always underestimate how long laundry takes, now I have to drive home at 1AM cause my parents are in NY and won't let me sleep over 
@Batgirl if I had it, I'd be there now...

To all you stoners happy 4:20, I wish I was going to see devil wears prada instead of seeing ten foot face 
Do u ever wake up on monday morning and think  I should have been working 18 hours days rather then enjoy the W ? I feel like that today! 
Missing ma precious, wish I was right beside him in Canada

@Stroopwaffle Yes, surely. I'd just rather try Valcyte first, but the public insurance only covers the massive cost for HIV+ patients.
