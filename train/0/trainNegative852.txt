@mynameisalbert oh...... I missed it 
The Silva fight was not what I expected. Over all UFC 97 a let down 
I'm wondering if anyone reads anymore?  I need someone to discuss with!!!!
@DakotaMcC got there as @cmykdorothy was leaving and after @3dogmcneill left ---dinner ran late 
I'm getting close, maybe a couple more days and I will have it, or several more inches, but that will never happen 
What a horrible ufc, the silva fight was pathetic. Sad end to chuck Liddell 
lol, good call. I'm attempting to do maths now, and I can't do it    fudge! I should have started this earlier!
