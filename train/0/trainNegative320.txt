Good morning world. Another cold day. 
My throat is killing me, and while I got a decent night's sleep last night, I still feel like I'm about to fall over.  
I'm so slow today  I need to finish this, but there is too many distractions!!! FOCUS, FOCUS!
The world is gray. I am depressed 
i really need to stop surfing the web when i have stuff in the oven...    poor biscuits
Camera should be here today.  I think I'm going to cry though, cause it won't stop the lonely I feel. 
@lunerose Oh no... I haven't watched any of the current season yet because I was afraid it would start to suck 
i am kind of bummed...did not make my numbers for the first time. 
i think i'm getting sick again. poop.
