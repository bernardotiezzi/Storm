@ThePenQueen i'm sorry to hear that, liz.  you have to try to think that maybe it happened this way for a reason.
I want the soundtrack to Juno now. 
I've been writing all day and I've written almost nothing I &quot;LIKE&quot;. I get all my best ideas in the shower.  I need a waterproof laptop.
To be honest, I don't know what I'm doing right now.

@barcodegurl Oh, honey.  That sucks! I'm always worried something like that will happen whenever I go on a trip somewhere.
So after sleeping for many hours, I'm convinced, and subsequently saddened, that I *don't* have Swine Flu. Nowhere near as epic.
