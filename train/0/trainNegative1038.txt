BEACH WAS BORING 
@quezed Ouch in regards to your Mech.  Heh probably should have some sort of warning sign w/silohette of Mech with outline of fire.;)
Phone is sleeping in a zip lock full of rice. 
Watching Dirty Dancing. Favourite movie of all time. Sad that Patrick Swayze is so sick these days. 
Does not like the F1 scene.. not ONE bit.. 
@BW101 wow, they're pretty crappy subjects haha. Also, I was totally going to write you a letter to go with it but I didn't get time 
Shame about the rain Jenson! 
Unfortunately it is too windy to go zorbing now  Just trying to work out a Plan B.
tired after watching #f1. Exciting stuff. Must resist falling to sleep now  Cup of tea will do the trick nicely
Really doesn't want to have to get up at 7am tomorrow 
@blazersedge 
Holy crap! Thunderstorm my ass! This is more like hurricane betsy! I just know my backyard is under water again.
