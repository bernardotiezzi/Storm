@sausagesmcgee  sorry to hear your cat died.  That's always shit.  I miss mine immensely (he's in the UK still)

Shame processing pics isn't as much fun as actually taking them  .
just woken up, finally got to sleep last night, alone, on the couch  watching one tree hill eating cheese and crackers!
@plastikgyrl Gah, of course. HUGE mess. 
@Darnell hmm, still a nogo. Up here in Canada we're pretty restricted to what tv we can watch online because of copyright laws.
