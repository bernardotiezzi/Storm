Only downside of visiting my parents, is eating ALL DAY LONG! And i've been doing so good at home. Spring training takes an L tonight. 
Went to bed good and early... didn't get to sleep till 3. Insomnia is a bitch 
I still have to wake up early for work 
Urgh don't like been up this early. Can only mean one thing... school 
At home sick with a lousy cold 
wtf it was gorgeous this weekend and its supposed to be rainy and cold next weekend. Mother Nature is a cruel bitch. 
@JamieLynn84 @jimalger when then someone will be left out 
@roaritsallie yup... kill me. My life is no longer fair in anyway. 
@GavinThompson I'd love to bake cookies, but currently I'd much rather just eat them sans the baking effort. 
QA jobs in the Australian Video Game industry seem thin on the ground  next stop: gaming journalism or graphic design lol
Not much more irritating than wanting to learn a song and not having your guitar  I should probably go to bed anyways
