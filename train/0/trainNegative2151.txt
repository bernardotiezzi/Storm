@StephanieSar  From my experience, sleeping 5-10 just makes me want to sleep more during the night. 
Being with someone who has a boyfriend at a party makes me sad and makes me realize i dont have anyone 
So I am guessin @donniewahlberg meant midnight Pacific time 
@FashionGuru Going to sleep, disappointed!!
