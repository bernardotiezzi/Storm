You never realize how much you'll miss someone until they are leaving or have already left...5 days until goodbye..Im gonna miss him 
lost my phone, no numbers....the silence is deafening 
Today I go back to NY without him 
back from Mass &amp; lunch...about to go to the NC or library to work on my paper so I won't be distracted...not feeling very inspired, sigh 
Raining AGAIN!!!! I swear I will never be able to get in the kayak!!!!! The river is just too high!!!
