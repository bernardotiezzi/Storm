This is a weird time. Has been for the last 7 years. I wish it didn't play on my mind as much as it does ...how did I let it happen?

@perezhilton She answered it poorly -- but unfortunately, I didn't hear any boos from the audience, only applause   Very depressing ....
I'm coming up with different ideas for videos/songs/orphan organizations. I'm always daydreaming about everything.. but biology and math. 
Wondering when the sun will come out again. (sighs)
