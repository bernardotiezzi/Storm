@EllenMalloy nope. Not yet, a lot of them don't allow edibles  Many of them have waiting lists also.

I rather think what i just did could be construed as drink driving.  No driving now for a least 5 hours.
@cafflo You know what to do when you feel sleepy. But you're gonna need your sleep today tho, so dont do that.
