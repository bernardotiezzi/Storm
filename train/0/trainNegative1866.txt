Ugh, this management test I have Wednesday is going to suuuuck.  I wish I had a day to do nothing except study.
if I don't get at least 56% on this exam, I fail the course, and I also have to beg my registrar to let me take 2.5 courses in the summer 
Think my head is going to fall off  owww!
@Punno That's what they tell me  I have been under some major stresses lately, so maybe. And no thank you, I'll be good, u just study ;)
