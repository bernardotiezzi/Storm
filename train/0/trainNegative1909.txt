@JustForSneaks07  I hate summer tho.

@kevatkinson cold  waiting for sun to come out
@renailemay Absolutely! And they're not the only ones missing out, as you said in one of your articles the NSW gov dodged floss too 
I still haven't started homework yet  I suck.  Sure wish it was the weekend and that it was raining.  That would make me happy.
@Sera_Bishop exactly thats whats happening... especially when you have a trainee and you cant work with him cos he is just not interested
