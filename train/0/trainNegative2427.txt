@joedawson Was indeed a good film. I could see some of the CGI though   Worst bit was the shadows from the kids who walked on the grass.

@TapDancingNews I love Andrew Nemr! He's so talented, but alas I can't make to NY in under 2 hours! 
Damn Revision, why must it take up all my time, i want to start reading Dot Robot, not maths notes or devices and circuits
